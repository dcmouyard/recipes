# Flank Steak

Serves: 4

 Slice the steak as thin as possible against the grain.

## Ingredients

- 1	(1½- to 1¾-pound) flank steak, trimmed
- 2	teaspoons kosher salt
- 1	teaspoon sugar
- ½	teaspoon pepper

- 1 large shallot, minced
- ½ cup red wine
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces and chilled
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
- ¼ teaspoon balsamic vinegar
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 225 degrees. Pat steak dry with paper towels. Cut steak in half lengthwise. Cut each piece in half crosswise to create 4 steaks. Combine 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and ½ teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Sprinkle half of salt mixture on 1 side of steaks and press gently to adhere. Flip steaks and repeat with remaining salt mixture.

2. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet; transfer sheet to oven. Cook until thermometer inserted through side into center of thickest steak registers 120 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes. Open the oven as infrequently as possible. If the meat is not yet up to temperature, wait at least 5 minutes before taking its temperature again.

3. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from pan used to cook meat. Add shallot to pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes.

4. Add ½ cup wine and simmer rapidly, scraping up any browned bits, until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 30 seconds.

5. Stir in ¾ cup chicken broth and 2 teaspoons brown sugar and simmer until reduced to ⅓ cup, 4 to 6 minutes.

6. Stir in any accumulated meat juices. Off heat, whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, until melted and sauce is thickened and glossy. Stir in rosemary and ¼ teaspoon balsamic vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste, spoon over meat, and serve.
