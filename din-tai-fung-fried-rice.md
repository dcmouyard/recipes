# Din Tai Fung Fried Rice

★★★★☆

Goes well with shrimp.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups uncooked white rice, Nishiki or Jasmine
* 4 scallions, chopped with whites and greens separated
* 4 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* ½ teaspoon white pepper
* ¼ teaspoon MSG
* 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Cook rice (preferably in a rice cooker.) If using freshly cooked rice, use slightly less water for firmer rice.

2. In a carbon steel wok or pan over medium high heat, heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and fry scallion whites for 15 seconds.

3. Add 4 large eggs and scramble, combining with the scallion whites. Cook for 45 seconds or until the eggs are about 75% cooked through (soft and slightly runny).

4. Turn the heat to high and add cooked white rice. Mix to incorporate the eggs, scallions, and rice. Continue cooking until the rice is dry and separated, about 2-3 minutes.

5. Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, ½ teaspoon white pepper, ¼ teaspoon MSG, and 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder. Mix thoroughly into the rice until incorporated. Taste and adjust for seasoning.

6. Add scallion greens and ½ pound cooked meat, toss and cook for another minute.
