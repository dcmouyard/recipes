# Chile con Carne

Serves: 6-8

## Ingredients

* 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes
* 4 slices bacon, chopped fine
* 1 (3½- to 4-pound) boneless beef chuck-eye roast, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
* Salt and pepper
* 1 onion, chopped fine
* ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (or 16 drops hot sauce)
* 3 tablespoons chili powder
* 1½ teaspoons ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon dried oregano
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 cups water
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons corn flour
* 2 teaspoons minced chipotle chiles in adobo sauce (optional)
* 1 jalapeño chile, seeded and chopped fine (optional)

## Instructions

1. Use your hands to pull apart the meat at its natural seams. Trim and discard large pockets of fat. Cut into 1-inch cubes.

2. Process tomatoes and chipotle in food processor until smooth.

3. Cook bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towel-lined plate and reserve 5 tablespoons bacon fat.

4. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon reserved bacon fat in empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown half of beef, about 8 minutes. Transfer to bowl and repeat with additional tablespoon bacon fat and remaining beef.

5. Add tablespoon bacon fat, onion, and jalapeño to empty Dutch oven and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.

6. Stir in cayene pepper, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

7. Stir in water, pureed tomato mixture, bacon, browned beef, and sugar and bring to boil.

8. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for 1 hour.

9. Skim fat and continue to simmer uncovered until meat is tender, 30 to 45 minutes.

10. In a separate sauce pan, heat 2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat over medium-high heat. (Use unsalted butter or vegetable oil if there’s not enough bacon fat.)

11. Reduce heat to medium and stir in corn flour gradually with wooden spatula or spoon, working out any small lumps. Continue stirring constantly, about 3-5 minutes.

12. Ladle 1 cup chili liquid into roux and stir until uniformly mixed.

13. Slowly whisk mixture into chili and simmer until chili is slightly thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Serve. (Chili can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)
