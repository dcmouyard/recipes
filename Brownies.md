# Brownies

★★★★★

Time: 1½ hours

## Ingredients

- ⅓ cup Dutch-processed cocoa
- 1½ teaspoons instant espresso
- ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water
- 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped
- 4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, melted
- ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs
- 2 large egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2½ cups (17½ ounces) sugar
- 1¾ cups (8¾ ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
- ¾ teaspoon table salt
- 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, cut into ½-inch pieces

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 350 degrees.

2. Make foil sling using the following steps: Cut 18-inch length foil and fold lengthwise to 8-inch width. Fit foil into length of 13 by 9-inch baking pan, pushing it into corners and up sides of pan; allow excess to overhang pan edges. Cut 14-inch length foil and fit into width of pan in the same manner, perpendicular to the first sheet (if using extra-wide foil, fold second sheet lengthwise to 12-inch width). Spray with nonstick cooking spray.

3. Whisk ⅓ cup cocoa, 1½ teaspoons espresso powder, and ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons boiling water together in large bowl until smooth.

4. Add 2 ounces finely chopped unsweetened chocolate and whisk until chocolate is melted.

5. Whisk in 4 tablespoons melted butter and ½ cup plus 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. (Mixture may look curdled.)

6. Add 2 large eggs, 2 large egg yolks, and 2 teaspoons vanilla and continue to whisk until smooth and homogeneous.

7. Whisk in 2½ cups sugar until fully incorporated. Add 1¾ cups flour and ¾ teaspoon salt and mix with rubber spatula until combined.

8. Fold in 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate pieces.

9. Scrape batter into prepared pan and bake until toothpick inserted halfway between edge and center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 30 to 35 minutes.

10. Transfer pan to wire rack and cool 1½ hours.

11. Using foil overhang, lift brownies from pan. Return brownies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 1 hour. Cut into 2-inch squares and serve.
