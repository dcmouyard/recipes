# Rhubarb Fool

Serves: 8

## Ingredients

* 2¼ pounds fresh rhubarb, trimmed of ends and cut into 6-inch lengths
* ⅓ cup orange juice
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
* Pinch table salt
* 2 cups heavy cream, (cold)

## Instructions

1. Soak rhubarb in 1 gallon cold water for 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry with paper towels, and cut rhubarb crosswise into slices ½-inch thick.

2. Bring ⅓ cup orange juice, ¾ cup sugar, and a pinch of salt to boil in medium nonreactive saucepan over medium-high heat.

3. Add rhubarb and return to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring only 2 or 3 times (frequent stirring causes rhubarb to become mushy), until rhubarb begins to break down and is tender, 7 to 10 minutes.

4. Transfer rhubarb to nonreactive bowl, cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour or up to 24.

5. Beat 2 cups heavy cream and 6 tablespoons sugar in bowl of standing mixer on low speed until small bubbles form, about 45 seconds. Increase speed to medium; continue beating until beaters leave a trail, about 45 seconds longer. Increase speed to high; continue beating until cream is smooth, thick, and nearly doubled in volume and forms soft peaks, about 30 seconds.

6. To assemble fool, spoon about ¼ cup rhubarb into each of eight 8-ounce glasses, then spoon in a layer of about ¼ cup whipped cream. Repeat, ending with dollop of cream; serve. Can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 6 hours. (To make one large fool, double the recipe and layer rhubarb and whipped cream in a 12-cup glass bowl.)
