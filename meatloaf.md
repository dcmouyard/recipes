# Meatloaf

★★★★★

Serves: 6-8
Time: 140 minutes

You can use 2 pounds meatloaf mix in place of the ground beef, pork, and veal. If you like, you can also omit the bacon topping from the loaf. In this case, brush on half the glaze before baking and the other half during the last fifteen minutes of baking.

## Ingredients

* ½ cup Heinz 57 sauce, chili sauce, or ketchup
* 4 tablespoons brown sugar
* 4 teaspoons cider vinegar, or white vinegar
* 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped medium
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
* 2 large eggs
* ½ teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
* ¼ teaspoon hot pepper sauce
* ½ cup whole milk, or plain yogurt
* 1 pound ground beef chuck
* ½ pound ground pork
* ½ pound ground veal
* ⅔ cup Ritz crackers, crushed (about 16), or quick oatmeal, or 1⅓ cups fresh bread crumbs
* ⅓ cup minced fresh parsley leaves
* 6-8 ounces bacon, thin sliced (8 to 12 slices, depending on loaf shape)

## Instructions

1. Mix ½ cup ketchup, 4 tablespoons brown sugar, and 4 teaspoons vinegar in small saucepan; set aside.

2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in medium skillet. Add onion and garlic; sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool while preparing remaining ingredients.

3. Mix eggs with ½ teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, 2 teaspoons mustard, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, ¼ teaspoon pepper sauce, and ½ cup milk.

4. Add egg mixture to meat in large bowl along with crackers, parsley, and cooked onion and garlic; mix with fork until evenly blended and meat mixture does not stick to bowl. (If mixture sticks, add additional milk, a couple tablespoons at a time until mix no longer sticks.)

5. Turn meat mixture onto work surface. With wet hands, pat mixture into approximately 9-by-5-inch loaf shape. Place on foil-lined (for easy cleanup) shallow baking pan. Brush with half the glaze, then arrange bacon slices, crosswise, over loaf, overlapping slightly and tucking only bacon tip ends under loaf.

6. Bake loaf until bacon is crisp and loaf registers 160 degrees, about 1 hour.

7. Cool at least 20 minutes. Simmer remaining glaze over medium heat until thickened slightly. Slice meat loaf and serve with extra glaze passed separately.
