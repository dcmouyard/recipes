# Fried Rice

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 30 minutes

Make sure the pan is smoking hot, and stir the rice constantly when cooking. If the pan isn’t hot enough, the food will steam and stick together.

## Ingredients

- 4 cups leftover white rice
- 4 teaspoons vegetable oil

- 5 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon hot sauce (optional)
- 1 tablespoon grated ginger (optional)

- 4 large eggs, beaten lightly

- 8-10 scallions, white parts sliced thin, green parts cut into ½-inch pieces
- 1 shallot, minced (optional)
- 1 cup vegetables, fresh or cooked (optional)

## Instructions

1. Combine soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce, and ginger in small bowl. In another bowl, beat eggs with 2 tablespoons soy sauce mixture until combined.

2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add egg mixture to pan and cook, scrambling and breaking into small pieces, until just set, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to plate.

3. Heat remaining oil in empty skillet until just smoking. Cook scallion whites, shallots, and vegetables until just beginning to soften, about 30 to 60 seconds. Add rice and remaining soy sauce mixture and cook until liquid has evaporated and rice is heated through, 2 to 4 minutes.

4. Stir in egg and scallion greens and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, about 1 minute.
