Serves: 8-10
Time: 4 hours

## Ingredients

* 8 slices bacon, chopped medium
* 1 small onion, chopped fine
* 1 green bell pepper, chopped fine
* 1 rib celery, chopped fine
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* Ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano leaves, or ¼ teaspoon dried
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, or ¼ teaspoon dried
* ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 4 bay leaves
* Table salt
* 1 pound dried red kidney beans, rinsed and picked over

* 7 cups water
* ½ pound andouille sausage or kielbasa, halved lengthwise and cut into ¼-inch half-moons
* 6 cups cooked long-grain rice (from 3 cups raw rice)

## Instructions

1. Cook bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat until lightly browned and fat has rendered, about 7 minutes.

2. Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 8 minutes.

3. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

4. Add 1 teaspoon pepper, oregano, thyme, cayenne, bay leaves, ½ teaspoon salt, beans, broth, and water, and bring to boil over high heat.

5. Reduce heat to maintain vigorous simmer (mixture will be steaming and several bubbles should be breaking the surface) and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until beans are soft and liquid thickens, 2 to 2½ hours.

6. Stir in sausage and cook until liquid is thick and creamy, about 30 minutes.

7. Season with salt and pepper. Serve over hot cooked rice with hot pepper sauce, if desired.
