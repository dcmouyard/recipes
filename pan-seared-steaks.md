# Pan-Seared Steak

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* 4 boneless 8-ounce rib-eye steaks, or top loin steaks, 1 to 1¼ inches thick, thoroughly dried with paper towels
* Salt and ground black pepper
* 1 large shallot, minced
* ½ cup red wine
* ¾ cup chicken broth
* 2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces and chilled
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
* ¼ teaspoons balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

1. Heat cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, season both sides of steaks with salt and pepper.

2. Lay steaks in pan, leaving ¼-inch of space between each; reduce heat to medium-high, and cook without moving until well browned, about 4 minutes.

3. Using tongs, flip steaks; cook 4 minutes more for rare, 5 minutes more for medium-rare, and 6 minutes more for medium. Transfer steaks to large plate and tent with foil to keep warm.

4. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from skillet. Add shallot to pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes.

5. Add wine and simmer rapidly, scraping up any browned bits, until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 30 seconds.

6. Stir in broth and sugar and simmer until reduced to ⅓ cup, 4 to 6 minutes.

7. Stir in any accumulated meat juices. Off heat, whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, until melted and sauce is thickened and glossy. Stir in rosemary and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste, spoon over meat, and serve.
