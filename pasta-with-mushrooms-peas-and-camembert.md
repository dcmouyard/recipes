# Pasta with Mushrooms, Peas, and Camembert

Serves: 4 (6-8 as side dish)

So that the sauce and pasta finish cooking at the same time, drop the pasta into boiling water just after adding the cremini to the skillet. To make the dish vegetarian, substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth.

## Ingredients

* table salt
* 1 pound farfalle pasta, or campanelle
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 3–4 large shallots, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
* 3 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
* 10 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, caps wiped clean and sliced ¼ inch thick
* 10 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and sliced ¼ inch thick
* 1 cup frozen peas
* 1¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth
* ½ cup heavy cream
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice from one lemon
* Ground black pepper
* 6 ounces Camembert, cut into ½-inch cubes (do not remove rind)
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives

## Instructions

1. Bring 4 quarts water to rolling boil, covered, in stockpot; add 1-tablespoon salt and pasta, stir to separate, and cook until just shy of al dente. Drain and return pasta to stockpot.

2. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil over medium heat in 12-inch skillet until foaming; add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes.

3. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

4. Increase heat to medium-high; add shiitakes and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes.

5. Add cremini mushrooms and ½ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 8 minutes.

6. Transfer mushrooms to bowl. Add frozen peas and 1¼ cups broth to skillet and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits; off heat, stir in ½ cup cream, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.

7. Add mushrooms, broth mixture, cheese, and chives to pasta in stockpot. Toss over medium-low heat until pasta absorbs most of liquid, about 2 minutes; serve immediately.
