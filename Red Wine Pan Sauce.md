# Red Wine Pan Sauce

## Ingredients

- 1 large shallot, minced
- ½ cup red wine
- ¾ cup chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons packed brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces and chilled
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
- ¼ teaspoon balsamic vinegar

## Instructions

1. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat from pan used to cook meat. Add shallot to pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes.

2. Add ½ cup wine and simmer rapidly, scraping up any browned bits, until liquid is reduced to glaze, about 30 seconds.

3. Stir in ¾ cup broth and 2 teaspoons brown sugar and simmer until reduced to ⅓ cup, 4 to 6 minutes.

4. Stir in any accumulated meat juices. Off heat, whisk in butter, 1 piece at a time, until melted and sauce is thickened and glossy. Stir in rosemary and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste, spoon over meat, and serve.
