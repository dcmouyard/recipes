# Pork Chops with Garlic Sauce

Serves: 4

Buy chops of similar thickness so that they cook at the same rate. If using table salt, sprinkle each chop with ½ teaspoon salt. We prefer the flavor of natural chops over that of enhanced chops (which have been injected with a salt solution and sodium phosphate to increase moistness and flavor), but if processed pork is all you can find, skip the salting step below.

## Ingredients

* 4 bone-in rib loin pork chops, 1½ inches thick (about 12 ounces each)
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper
* 1-2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 large shallot, minced (about ¼ cup)
* 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, or ¼ teaspoon dried
* ¼ teaspoon white wine vinegar
* 3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 3 pieces

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Pat chops dry with paper towels. Using sharp knife, cut 2 slits, about 2 inches apart, through outer layer of fat and silver skin opposite the bone of the chop.

2. Sprinkle entire surface of each chop with 1 teaspoon salt. Place chops on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and let stand at room temperature 45 minutes.

3. Season chops liberally with pepper; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into centers of chops and away from bones registers 120 to 125 degrees, 30 to 45 minutes.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking. Place 2 chops in skillet and sear until well browned and crusty, 1½ to 3 minutes, lifting once halfway through to redistribute fat underneath each chop. (Reduce heat if browned bits in pan bottom start to burn.)

5. Using tongs, turn chops and cook until well browned on second side, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chops to plate and repeat with remaining 2 chops, adding extra tablespoon oil if pan is dry.

6. Reduce heat to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 pork chops on their sides. Holding chops together with tongs, return to skillet and sear sides of chops (with exception of bone side) until browned and instant-read thermometer inserted into center of chop and away from bone registers 140 to 145 degrees, about 1½ minutes. Repeat with remaining 2 chops. Let chops rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10 minutes while preparing sauce.

7. Pour off all but 1 teaspoon oil from pan used to cook chops and return pan to medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until softened, about 1 minute.

8. Add wine and broth, scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits. Simmer until reduced to ½ cup, 6 to 7 minutes.

9. Off heat, stir in thyme and vinegar, then whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Season with salt and pepper and serve with chops.
