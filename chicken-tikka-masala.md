# Chicken Tikka Masala

Serves: 4-6

Best served with Basmati rice. You can substitute 2 teaspoons ground coriander, ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom, ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon, and ½ teaspoon ground black pepper for the garam masala.

## Ingredients

### Chicken Tikka

* ½ teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon ground coriander
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed of fat
* 1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
* 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

### Masala Sauce

* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 medium onion, diced fine (about 1¼ cups)
* 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
* 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
* 1 fresh serrano chile, ribs and seeds removed, flesh minced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* ½ teaspoon table salt
* ⅔ cup heavy cream
* ¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves

## Instructions

1. Combine ½ teaspoon cumin, ½ teaspoon coriander, ¼ teaspoon cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt in small bowl. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with spice mixture, pressing gently so mixture adheres. Place chicken on plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.

2. In large bowl, whisk together 1 cup yogurt, 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, and 1 tablespoon ginger; set aside.

3. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until light golden, 8 to 10 minutes.

4. Add garlic, 2 teaspoons ginger, chile, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, and 1 tablespoon garam masala; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes.

5. Add crushed tomatoes, 2 teaspoons sugar, and ½ teaspoon salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. Stir in ⅔ cup cream and return to simmer. Remove pan from heat and cover to keep warm.

7. While sauce simmers, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (about 6 inches from heating element) and heat broiler. Using tongs, dip chicken into yogurt mixture (chicken should be coated with thick layer of yogurt) and arrange on wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Discard excess yogurt mixture. Broil chicken until thickest parts register 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer and exterior is lightly charred in spots, 10 to 18 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.

8. Let chicken rest 5 minutes, then cut into 1-inch chunks and stir into warm sauce (do not simmer chicken in sauce). Stir in cilantro, adjust seasoning with salt, and serve.
