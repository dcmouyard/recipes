# Dinner Rolls

★★★★★

Makes: 12 rolls
Time: 4 hours

Can double this recipe without issue in a Kitchen Aid mixer.

## Ingredients

- ½ cup water
- 3 tablespoons bread flour
- ½ cup cold milk
- 1 large egg
- 2 cups (11 ounces / 312 grams) bread flour
- 1½ teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast (or 1⅞ teaspoons active dry yeast)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ½ tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

## Instructions

1. Whisk ½ cup water and 3 tablespoons bread flour together in small bowl until no lumps remain. Microwave, whisking every 20 seconds, until mixture thickens to stiff, smooth, pudding-like consistency that forms a mound when dropped from end of whisk into bowl, 40 to 80 seconds.

2. In bowl of stand mixer, whisk flour paste and ½ cup cold milk together until smooth.

3. Add 1 large egg and whisk until incorporated.

4. Add 2 cups bread flour and 1½ teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast. Fit stand mixer with dough hook and mix on low speed until all flour is moistened, 1 to 2 minutes.

5. Let stand for 15 minutes.

6. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and mix on medium-low speed for 5 minutes.

7. With mixer running, add 4 tablespoons unsalted softened butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, scraping down dough hook and sides of bowl occasionally (dough will stick to bottom of bowl).

8. Transfer dough to counter and knead briefly to form ball and transfer, seam side down, to lightly greased bowl; lightly coat surface of dough with vegetable oil spray and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

9. Grease 9-inch round cake pan or cast iron skillet and set aside.

10. Transfer dough to counter. Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Pat and stretch dough to form 8 by 9-inch rectangle with short side facing you.

11. Cut dough lengthwise into 4 equal strips and cut each strip crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece at a time, stretch and press dough gently to form 8 by 2-inch strip. Starting on short side, roll dough to form snug cylinder and arrange shaped rolls seam side down in prepared pan, placing 10 rolls around edge of pan, pointing inward, and remaining 2 rolls in center. Cover with plastic and let rise until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

12. When rolls are nearly doubled, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Bake rolls until deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.

13. Let rolls cool in pan on wire rack for 3 minutes; invert rolls onto rack, then reinvert. Brush tops and sides of rolls with ½ tablespoon unsalted melted butter. Let rolls cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.
