# Cheese Soufflé

★★★★☆

Serves: 3-4
Time: 105 minutes

## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch chunks, plus extra for coating the dish
* ½ ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about ¼ cup)
* 1 small minced shallot
* 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1 cup whole milk
* 4 ounces Gruyère cheese, shredded (about 1 cup)
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
* Pinch fresh ground nutmeg
* 3 large eggs, separated
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves
* 1½ tablespoons minced fresh tarragon leaves
* ¼ teaspoon cream of tartar

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Thoroughly butter the inside of a 2-quart soufflé dish, then coat evenly with 2 tablespoons of the Parmesan; set aside.

2. Melt the 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and sautè until softened, about 2 minutes.

3. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour and cook until golden, about 1 minute.

4. Slowly whisk in 1 cup milk. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until thickened and smooth, about 1 minute.

5. Off the heat, whisk in the Gruyère, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and nutmeg. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Whisk in the egg yolks until completely incorporated. Stir in chives, parsley, and tarragon, and set aside.

6. Using an electric mixer, whip the egg whites in a separate bowl on medium-low speed until they are opaque and frothy, about 30 seconds. Add the cream of tartar, increase the speed to medium-high, and continue to whip, watching carefully, until they are thick and form stiff peaks, about 2½ minutes.

4. Working with one-quarter of the whipped egg whites at a time, gently fold them into the yolk mixture until almost no white streaks remain (a few streaks are okay). Gently pour the mixture into the prepared soufflé dish and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan.

5. Bake until the top is nicely browned, the center jiggles slightly, and an instant-read thermometer inserted through the top side registers 170 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve immediately.
