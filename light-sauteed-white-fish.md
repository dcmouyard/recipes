# Light Sautéed White Fish

★★★★☆

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* 4 boneless, skinless thick fish fillets, ½ to 1 inch thick (about 6 ounces each) or 8 boneless, skinless thin fish fillets, ¼ to ½ inch thick (about 3 ounces)
* Salt and ground black pepper
* ½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges (for serving)

## Instructions

For the purpose of this recipe, we are putting the fish into two categories: thick and thin fillets. Fish fillets that are ½ to 1 inch thick fall into the thick category, while the thin category includes fillets that are ¼ to ½ inch thick. Note that the sauce recipes that are related are meant to be prepared before the fish fillets are cooked. The sauce is then held until serving.

1. Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels and season them with salt and pepper. Let the fish stand until glistening with moisture, about 5 minutes. If using tail-end fillets, score and tuck the end under following the illustrations at left. Spread the flour in a shallow dish. Lightly dredge the fillets in the flour and shake off the excess (keeping any tail ends tucked).

2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Place half of the fillets in the pan in a single layer and immediately reduce the heat to medium-high. Cook, without moving the fish, until the edges of the fillets are opaque and the bottoms are golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes for thick fillets or 2 to 3 minutes for thin fillets.

3. Using a spatula, gently flip the fillets over. Continue to cook on the second side until the thickest part of the fillets is firm to the touch and the fish just flakes apart, 2 to 3 minutes for thick fillets, or 30 to 60 seconds for thin fillets.

4. Transfer the fillets to a serving platter and tent with foil. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and return to high heat until the oil is shimmering but not smoking; cook the remaining fillets in the same manner as the first ones. Place the second batch of fillets on the platter with the first batch; tilt the platter to discard any accumulated liquid. Serve the fish immediately with the lemon wedges or one of the related sauces, if desired.
