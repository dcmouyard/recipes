Serves: 8-10

## Ingredients

* 2½ pounds ground Italian sausage (not links)
* 1 tablespoon bacon grease
* 2 medium yellow onions, chopped fine (about 2 cups)
* 1¼ teaspoons dried Turkish oregano
* 6 ounces tomato paste
* 6-10 medium garlic cloves, pressed through garlic press
* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ½ cup red wine (Pinot Noir)
* 2 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
* 1 tablespoon Gravy Master
* 1 tablespoon Liquid Smoke
* 2 tablespoons beef bouillon
* 2 pounds spaghetti or linguine
* 2 tablespoons table salt
* ¼ cup chopped fresh basil leaves
* Grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese (optional)
* Crushed red pepper flakes (optional)

## Instructions

1. Cook italian sausage in Dutch oven over medium heat until no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Transfer to large bowl and cover.

2. Melt 1 tablespoon bacon grease in Dutch oven. Add chopped onions and oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.

3. Add 6 ounces tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until very dark, about 3 minutes.

4. Clear a small space in the middle of the Dutch oven and add 1 teaspoon olive oil. Add garlic to olive oil and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir thoroughly with the rest of the sauce.

5. Add ½ cup red wine, scraping up any browned bits. Cook until most of the wine has evaporated.

6. Add 56 ounces crushed tomatoes, 1 tablespoon Gravy Master, 1 tablespoon Liquid Smoke, and 2 tablespoons beef bouillon. Return Italian sausage to pot; bring to simmer and cover.

7. Meanwhile, bring 6 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add pasta and 2 tablespoons salt and cook until al dente, about 9 minutes.

8. Reserve ½ cup cooking water; drain pasta and transfer back to cooking pot.

9. Stir ¼ cup chopped fresh basil leaves into sauce.

10. Toss pasta with 1 cup sauce and reserved pasta cooking water so that sauce lightly coats pasta. Serve pasta, passing remaining sauce, cheese, and crushed red pepper flakes separately.
