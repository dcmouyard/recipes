# Waffles

★★★★★

Makes: 9 waffles
Time: 45 minutes

While the waffles can be eaten as soon as they are removed from the waffle iron, they will have a crispier exterior if rested in a warm oven for 10 minutes. (This method also makes it possible to serve everyone at the same time.)

## Ingredients

* 4 cups (20 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoon sugar
* 1½ teaspoon table salt
* 1 cup dried buttermilk powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup sour cream
* 4 large eggs
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* ½ cup vegetable oil
* 2½ cups unflavored seltzer water

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place baking sheet in oven.

2. Whisk 4 cups flour, 2 tablespoon sugar, 1½ teaspoon salt, 1 cup buttermilk powder, and 1 teaspoon baking soda in large bowl to combine.

3. Whisk 1 cup sour cream, 4 eggs, ½ teaspoon vanilla, and ½ cup oil in medium bowl to combine. Gently stir 2½ cups seltzer into wet ingredients.

4. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir until just combined. Batter should remain slightly lumpy with streaks of flour.

5. Heat waffle iron on setting 3 or 4, and fill each mold with about ⅔ cups batter.

6. Transfer waffles to rack in warm oven and hold for up to 10 minutes before serving with butter and maple syrup.
