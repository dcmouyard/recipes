# Waffles

Makes: 8 7-inch round waffles

While the waffles can be eaten as soon as they are removed from the waffle iron, they will have a crispier exterior if rested in a warm oven for 10 minutes. (This method also makes it possible to serve everyone at the same time.)

## Ingredients

* 2	cups (10 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1	tablespoon sugar
* ¾	teaspoon table salt
* ½	cup dried buttermilk powder
* ½	teaspoon baking soda
* ½	cup sour cream
* 2	large eggs
* ¼	teaspoon vanilla extract
* ¼	cup vegetable oil
* 1¼ cups unflavored seltzer water

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place baking sheet in oven.

2. Whisk 2 cups flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, ¾	teaspoon salt, ½	cup buttermilk powder, and ½teaspoon baking soda in large bowl to combine.

3. Whisk ½ cup sour cream, 2 eggs, ¼ teaspoon vanilla, and ¼ cup oil in medium bowl to combine. Gently stir 1¼ cups seltzer into wet ingredients.

4. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir until just combined. Batter should remain slightly lumpy with streaks of flour.

5. Heat waffle iron and bake waffles according to manufacturer’s instructions (use about ⅓ cup for 7-inch round iron). Transfer waffles to rack in warm oven and hold for up to 10 minutes before serving with butter and maple syrup.
