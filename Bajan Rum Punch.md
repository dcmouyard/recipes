# Bajan Rum Punch

The traditional recipe follows the rhyme: “One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak,” which refers to the proportions of lime juice, sugar, rum, and water, respectively, often garnished with nutmeg.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup fresh squeezed lime juice
- 2 cups Bajan home made sugar syrup made with raw cane sugar dissolved into water until it is a thick brown syrup.
- 3 cups dark Bajan rum
- 4 cups water
- A good few dashes of Angostura Bitters
- Grated nutmeg
- A slice of lemon or lime (optional)

## Instructions

1. In a pitcher, combine the lime juice, syrup, rum, water, and bitters and stir well.
2. Pour into glasses filled with ice, and sprinkle the nutmeg over the top. 
3. Add a slice of lemon or lime.
