# Mashed Potatoes

★★★★★

Serves: 10-12
Time: 120 minutes

## Ingredients

* 5 pounds Yukon Gold potato, peeled
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 15 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces
* 5-10 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press
* 1¼ teaspoon sugar
* 1⅞ cups heavy cream
* 1 tablespoon plus 2½ teaspoons salt

## Instructions

1. Cut potatoes into ¾-inch slices. Place potatoes in colander and rinse under running water, tossing with hands, for 30 seconds. Transfer potatoes to Dutch oven and add cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon salt and bring to a boil over high heat.

2. Reduce heat to medium and boil until potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Potatoes should fall apart when prodded with a fork.

3. Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and sugar, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.

4. Warm heavy cream in a separate saucepan, and cook until warm, about 5 minutes. Keep warm.

5. Drain potatoes and return to Dutch oven. Stir over low heat until potatoes are thoroughly dried, 1 to 2 minutes.

6. Set ricer or food mill over large bowl and press or mill potatoes into bowl. Gently fold in warm cream mixture and salt with rubber spatula until cream is absorbed and potatoes are thick and creamy. Serve.
