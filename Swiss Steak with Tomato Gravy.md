# Swiss Steak with Tomato Gravy

★★☆☆☆

Serves: 6-8
Time: 3½ hours

Top blade-roast may also be labeled chuck roast first cut, top chuck roast, flat iron roast, or simply blade roast. Use low-sodium chicken broth or the gravy will be too salty.

## Ingredients

- 1 (3½-4 pound) boneless top blade roast
- Salt and pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 onion, halved and sliced thin
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ teaspoon dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes
- 1½ cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, rinsed, patted dry, and minced
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.

2. Place roast on cutting board and cut crosswise into four even pieces.

3. One piece at a time, turn meat on its side to expose the line of gristle that runs through its center.

4. Remove by slicing through meat on either side of gristle to yield two “steaks.” Repeat with remaining pieces of blade roast to yield a total of eight steaks.

5. Pat steaks dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat just until smoking. Brown 4 steaks, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining oil and steaks.

6. Add onion to empty pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, tomato paste, and flour and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in diced tomatoes and broth and bring to boil.

7. Return steaks and any accumulated juices to pan. Transfer to oven and braise, covered, until steaks are fork-tender, about 2 hours. Transfer steaks to platter, tent with foil, and let rest 5 minutes. Skim fat from sauce. Stir in sun-dried tomatoes and parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Pour sauce over steaks. Serve.
