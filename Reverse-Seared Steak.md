# Reverse-Seared Steak

## Ingredients

- Steak at least 1½ inches thick (Ribeye, Strip, Porterhouse, T-bone, Tri-tip, or Filet mignon)
- Kosher salt
- Seasoning (Ground pepper, Meat Magic, Creole, Montreal, etc.)
- 1 tablespoon oil with a high smoke point (Vegetable, Peanut, Corn, Beef tallow, etc.)
- 1 tablespoon butter

## Instructions

1. Pat steaks dry with paper towel. Season entire surface of steaks liberally with salt and seasoning. If uneven, gently press sides of steaks until uniformly thick.

2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees.

3. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven. For medium-rare, cook until instant-read thermometer inserted in center of steak registers 115 degrees, about 25 to 30 minutes. Could take longer if cooking thicker steaks.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet (large enough to accommodate steaks without overcrowding) over high heat until oil starts smoking.

5. Place steaks in skillet and top with butter. Sear steaks until well-browned, about 45 seconds per side. Using tongs, hold steaks sideways to sear edges.

6. If not serving right away due to making a pan sauce, transfer steaks to wire cooling rack and let rest, loosely tented with foil, for 5-10 minutes.
