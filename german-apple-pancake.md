# German Apple Pancake

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* ½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour, (2 1/2 ounces)
* 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon table salt
* 2 large eggs
* ⅔ cup half-and-half
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1¼ pounds Granny Smith apples, or Braeburn apples (3 to 4 large apples), peeled, quartered, cored, and cut into ½-inch-thick slices
* ¼ cup light brown sugar, or dark brown sugar
* ¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position; heat oven to 500 degrees.

2. Whisk to combine flour, granulated sugar, and salt in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk eggs, half-and-half, and vanilla until combined. Add liquid ingredients to dry and whisk until no lumps remain, about 20 seconds; set batter aside.

3. Heat butter in 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until sizzling. Add apples, brown sugar, and cinnamon; cook, stirring frequently with heatproof rubber spatula, until apples are golden brown, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in lemon juice.

4. Working quickly, pour batter around and over apples (see illustration 1 from "Step by Step: Preparing the Pancake). Place skillet in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees; bake until pancake edges are brown and puffy and have risen above edges of skillet, about 18 minutes.

5. Using oven mitts to protect hands, remove hot skillet from oven and loosen pancake edges with heatproof rubber spatula; invert pancake onto serving platter. Dust with confectioners’ sugar, cut into wedges, and serve.
