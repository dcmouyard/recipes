# Long Grain White Rice

★★★★★

Serves: 6-8
Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 cups long grain white rice (Ben’s Original)
- 2-3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 cups water (or unsalted beef/chicken stock)
- 1 teaspoon salt (optional)

## Instructions

1. Place 2 cups rice in fine-mesh strainer set over large bowl. Rinse under running water until water runs clear, about 1 minute. Drain rice well.

2. Melt 2-3 tablespoons butter in large saucepan (e.g., 10“) over medium heat. Add rice and cook, stirring frequently, until edges begin to turn translucent, about 2 minutes. Add 3 cups water and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil.

3. Cover, reduce heat to low (points to large dot near Medium on large burner,) and simmer until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 20 minutes.

4. Off heat, remove lid and let stand for 5-10 minutes. For sticky rice, place kitchen towel over saucepan. Fluff with fork. Serve.
