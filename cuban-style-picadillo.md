# Cuban-Style Picadillo

Serves: 6

## Ingredients

* 1 pound 85 percent lean ground beef
* 1 pound ground pork
* 2 tablespoons water
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* Salt and pepper
* 1 green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 2-inch pieces
* 1 onion, halved and cut into 2-inch pieces
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
* ¾ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup beef broth
* ½ cup raisins
* 3 bay leaves
* ½ cup pimento-stuffed green olives, chopped coarse
* 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar, plus extra for seasoning

## Instructions

1. Toss beef and pork with 2 tablespoons water, ½ teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside for 20 minutes.

2. Pulse bell pepper and onion in food processor until chopped into ¼-inch pieces, about 12 pulses.

3. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add chopped vegetables, 1 tablespoon oregano, 1 tablespoon cumin, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, and ¼ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.

4. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

5. Add tomatoes and ¾ cup white wine and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until pot is almost dry, 3 to 5 minutes.

6. Stir in ½ cup broth, ½ cup raisins, and 3 bay leaves and bring to simmer.

7. Reduce heat to medium-low, add meat mixture in 2-inch chunks to pot, and bring to gentle simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally with 2 forks to break meat chunks into ¼- to ½-inch pieces, until meat is cooked through, about 10 minutes.

8. Discard bay leaves. Stir in olives and capers. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened and coats meat, about 5 minutes.

9. Stir in 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar and season with salt, pepper, and extra vinegar to taste. Serve.
