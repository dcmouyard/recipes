# Dublin Coddle

★★★★★

Serves: 4-6
Time: 3 hours

Add more potatoes next time. Consider replacing some of the chicken stock with Guinness Draught.

## Ingredients

* 1¾ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and sliced ¼ inch thick
* Salt and pepper
* 4 slices thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1¼ pounds banger sausages (or any pork sausage: e.g., bratwurst, polish sausage)
* 2 onions, sliced into ½-inch-thick rings
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
* 1¾ cups unsalted chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Shingle potato slices in bottom of 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with ½ ­teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper; set aside.

2. Cook bacon in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crispy, 12 to 14 ­minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper towel–lined plate.

3. Carefully add sausages to now-empty skillet and cook until lightly browned on tops and bottoms, about 5 minutes. Transfer to paper towel–lined plate.

4. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from skillet and return to medium heat. Add onions, 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cover and cook until onions are softened, 7 to 9 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping up any browned bits.

5. Add 1¾ cups broth and 2 tablespoons vinegar, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Carefully pour onion mixture over potatoes, spreading onions into even layer.

6. Place sausages, browned side up, on top of onions. Transfer to oven and bake until paring knife inserted into potatoes meets little resistance, about 1¼ hours.

7. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and reserved bacon. Serve.
