# Cream Wafers

Makes: 30 cookies
Time:

Recipe from [[Colleen Claire Mouyard|Aunt Colleen]]. Any buttercream frosting recipe will do. This one is very rich so you might want to add Cool Whip to tone it down. Ready to serve frosting can also be used.

## Ingredients

### Wafers

- 1 cup softened butter
- ⅓ cup heavy whipping cream
- 2 cups flour
- Sugar

### Butter Frosting

- ¼ cup softened butter
- ¾ cup powdered sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Food coloring (optional)

## Instructions

1. Mix 1 cup softened butter, ⅓ cup heavy whipping cream, and 2 cups flour thoroughly. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour.

2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and roll out on generously floured work surface to about ⅛ inch thick. Cut with 1½ inch cookie cutter and transfer to waxed paper.

3. Heavily sprinkle with sugar, turning to coat both sides. Place on ungreased cookie sheet; prick each cookie several times with a fork.

4. Bake 7-9 minutes or until slightly puffy. Remove from cookie sheet and let cool.

5. For cream frosting, blend ¼ cup softened butter, ¾ cup powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and food coloring (optional).

6. Sandwich 2 wafers together with cream frosting in center.
