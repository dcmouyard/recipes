# Rum Cookie Pie

★★★★★

Makes: 1 pie

## Ingredients

* 1¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour (8¾ ounces)
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 14 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1¼ cups packed dark brown sugar (8¾ ounces)
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 1 tablespoon dark rum
* 1 large egg
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1¼ cups semisweet chocolate chips or chunks

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Whisk 1¾ cups flour and ½ teaspoon baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside.

2. Heat 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and, using heatproof spatula, transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining 4 tablespoons butter into hot butter until completely melted.

3. Add 1¼ cups dark brown sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 tablespoon dark rum to bowl with butter and whisk until fully incorporated. Add egg and yolk and whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let mixture stand 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. Using rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in chocolate chips and give dough final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain.

4. Spread dough mixture evenly over pizza stone. Bake until golden brown and still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating pizza stone halfway through baking.
