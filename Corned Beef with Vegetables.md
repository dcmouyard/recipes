# Corned Beef with Vegetables

★★★☆☆

Serves: 8-10
Time: 4½ hours

Need to corn the beef for at least 6 days. Needs more flavor. Need to cook the beef for much longer than 3 hours to make it tender enough.

## Ingredients

- 1 (4½-5 pounds) beef brisket, flat cut
- ¾ cup salt
- ½ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons pink curing salt #1 (Prague Powder #1)
- 6 garlic cloves, peeled
- 6 bay leaves
- 5 allspice berries
- 2 tablespoons peppercorns
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
- 6 carrots, peeled, halved crosswise, thick ends halved lengthwise
- 1½ pounds small red potatoes, unpeeled

## Instructions

### Corning

1. Trim fat on surface of brisket to ⅛ inch.

2. Dissolve ¾ cup salt, ½ cup brown sugar, and 2 teaspoons curing salt in 4 quarts water in large container. Add brisket, 3 garlic cloves, 4 bay leaves, 5 allspice berries, 1 tablespoon peppercorns, and 1 tablespoon coriander seeds to brine.

3. Weigh brisket down with plate, cover, and refrigerate for 6 days.

### Cooking

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Remove brisket from brine, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels.

2. Cut 8-inch square triple thickness of cheesecloth. Place 3 garlic cloves, 2 bay leaves, and 1 tablespoon peppercorns in center of cheesecloth and tie into bundle with kitchen twine. Place brisket, spice bundle, and 2 quarts water in Dutch oven. (Brisket may not lie flat but will shrink slightly as it cooks.)

3. Bring to simmer over high heat, cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until fork inserted into thickest part of brisket slides in and out with ease, 2½ to 3 hours.

4. Remove pot from oven and turn off oven. Transfer brisket to large oven-safe platter, ladle 1 cup of cooking liquid over meat, cover, and return to oven to keep warm.

5. Add carrots and potatoes to pot and bring to simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until vegetables begin to soften, 20 to 25 minutes.

6. While vegetables cook, transfer beef to cutting board and slice ¼ inch thick against grain. Return beef to platter. Using slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to platter with beef. Moisten with additional broth and serve.
