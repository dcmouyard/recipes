# Buttermilk Pancakes

★★★☆☆

Serves: 4-6
Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* 2 cups (10 ounces) all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 cups buttermilk
* ¼ cup sour cream
* 2 large eggs
* 3 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
* 1-2 teaspoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Spray wire rack set inside rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray; place in oven.

2. Whisk 2 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon salt together in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk 2 cups buttermilk, ¼ cup sour cream, 2 eggs, and 3 tablespoons melted butter together. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients; gently stir until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Do not overmix. Let batter sit 10 minutes before cooking.

3. Heat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of pan.

4. Using ¼-cup dry measuring cup, portion batter into pan in 4 places. Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes.

5. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer.

6. Serve pancakes immediately, or transfer to wire rack in preheated oven. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary.
