# Chicken Teriyaki

★★★★★

Serves: 4-6
Time: 60 minutes

You can also keep the bone in, but move the oven rack down to 12 inches from the broiler and cook for  20-26 minutes.

## Ingredients

* 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 5 ounces each), trimmed, boned, and skin slashed
* ½ cup soy sauce
* ½ cup sugar
* ½ teaspoon grated fresh ginger
* 1 clove garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 teaspoon)
* 2 tablespoons mirin (or white wine)
* ½ teaspoon cornstarch

## Instructions

1. Position oven rack about 8 inches from heat source; heat broiler. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper; set thighs skin side up on broiler pan (or foil-lined rimmed baking sheet fitted with flat wire rack), tucking exposed meat under skin and lightly flattening thighs to be of relatively even thickness. Broil until skin is crisp and golden brown and thickest parts of thighs register 175 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 8 to 14 minutes, rotating pan halfway through cooking time for even browning.

2. While chicken cooks, combine ½ cup soy sauce, ½ cup sugar, ½ teaspoon ginger, and 1 clove garlic in small saucepan; stir together 2 tablespoons mirin and ½ teaspoon cornstarch in small bowl until no lumps remain, then stir mirin mixture into saucepan. Bring sauce to boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce is reduced to ¾ cup and forms syrupy glaze, about 4 minutes. Cover to keep warm.

3. Transfer chicken to cutting board; let rest 2 to 3 minutes. Cut meat crosswise into ½-inch- wide strips. Transfer chicken to serving platter; stir teriyaki sauce to recombine, then drizzle to taste over chicken. Serve immediately, passing remaining sauce separately.
