# Turkey Gravy

Makes: 1 quart

## Ingredients

* Turkey giblets, neck, and backbone, hacked into 2-inch pieces
* 1 medium carrot, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 1 rib celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 small onions, chopped coarse
* 6 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 3½ cups chicken stock
* 2 cups dry white wine
* 6 sprigs fresh thyme
* ¼ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
* Salt and ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 450 degrees.

2. Place turkey trimmings, carrot, celery, onions, and garlic in large flameproof roasting pan. Spray lightly with cooking spray and toss to combine. Roast, stirring every 10 minutes, until well-browned, 40 to 50 minutes.

3. Remove roasting pan from oven, and place over burner(s) set at high heat; add chicken stock and bring to boil, scraping up browned bits on bottom of pan with wooden spoon.

4. Transfer contents of roasting pan to large saucepan. Add wine, 3 cups water, and thyme; bring to boil over high heat.

5. Reduce heat to low and simmer until reduced by half, about 1½ hours.

6. Strain stock into large measuring cup or container. Cool to room temperature; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until fat congeals, at least 1 hour.

7. To finish gravy, skim fat from stock using soup spoon; reserve fat. Pour stock through fine-mesh strainer to remove remaining bits of fat; discard bits in strainer. Bring stock to simmer in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.

8. In second medium saucepan, heat 4 tablespoons reserved turkey fat over medium-high heat until bubbling; whisk in flour and cook, whisking constantly, until combined and honey-colored, about 2 minutes.

9. Continuing to whisk constantly, gradually add hot stock; bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.

10. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve with turkey. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days; reheat in medium saucepan over medium heat until hot, about 8 minutes.)
