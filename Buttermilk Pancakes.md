# Buttermilk Pancakes

★★★★★

Serves: 4-6
Time: 20 minutes

If you don’t have buttermilk, combine 1 tablespoon lemon juice with 2 cups milk and set aside to thicken.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, (10 ounces)
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon table salt
- 1 large egg
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 cup fresh blueberries, rinsed and dried (optional)

## Instructions

1. Whisk 2 cups flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.

2. Whisk 1 egg and 3 tablespoons melted butter into 2 cups buttermilk until combined. Make well in center of dry ingredients in bowl; pour in milk mixture and whisk very gently until just combined (a few lumps should remain). Do not over mix.

3. Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for 3 to 5 minutes; add 1 teaspoon oil and brush to coat skillet bottom evenly. Pour ¼ cup batter onto 3 spots on skillet; sprinkle 1 tablespoon blueberries over each pancake. Cook pancakes until large bubbles begin to appear, 1½ to 2 minutes.

4. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on second side, 1 to 1½ minutes longer. Serve immediately, and repeat with remaining batter, using remaining vegetable oil only if necessary.
5. You can keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven at 200 °F.
