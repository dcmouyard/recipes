# Creamy Poblano Sauce

## Ingredients

- 4 poblano peppers (2-3 if large size peppers)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ⅓ cup diced onion (about ½ of medium onion)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 4 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 1 cup chicken stock
- 1 cup half & half
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cumin
- 1 tablespoon lime juice, juiced
- 12 leaves cilantro (optional)

## Instructions

1. Roast peppers until charred and blistered over open flame, grill, in 425°F oven, or under broiler, turning for even roasting.

2. Place hot peppers in foil, plastic bag, or in bowl covered with plastic wrap until cool enough to handle.

3. Peel peppers and then cut flesh away from stem, ribs and seed. Dice.

4. Melt butter over medium heat and then add ⅓ cup diced onion and peppers, stirring frequently until onions are limp.

5. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 minute.

6. Mix 1 cup stock and 1 cup half & half, then whisk in 4 tablespoons flour, whisking until all lumps are gone.

7. Slowly stir in the stock mixture, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon cumin to the pepper mixture and keep cooking and stirring until thickened.

8. Stir in 1 tablespoon lime juice and cilantro and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes.

9. If a smoother sauce is desired it can be blended with an immersion blender or briefly in a food processor before serving.
