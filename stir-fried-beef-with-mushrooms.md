# Stir-fried Beef with Mushrooms

★★★★★

Serves: 2-3

## Ingredients

* ½ pound flank steak, sliced about ⅛-inch thick
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon sugar
* ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper
* ½ teaspoon Shaoxing wine
* ½ teaspoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
* ½ teaspoon cornstarch
* 1 ginger piece, sliced ¼-inch thick
* ½ pound mushrooms, sliced ¼-inch thick
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 2 medium cloves garlic, finely minced (about 1 teaspoon)



## Instructions

1. Place the beef in a large bowl. Add ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon sugar, ⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper, ½ teaspoon Shaoxing wine, ½ teaspoon soy sauce, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, and ½ teaspoon cornstarch. Mix well and set aside for 30 minutes.

2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add the ginger. Cook for 30 seconds and then remove and discard the ginger.

3. If the wok is no longer smoking, reheat until it is, then add the beef. Spread the beef out into a single layer and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Continue to cook while stirring regularly until half cooked, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in wok over high heat until smoking. Add the mushrooms. Stir and cook the mushrooms until they start releasing their water. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until the water evaporates. Depending on the type of mushrooms you use, this can take 5 minutes or more.

5. Once the water evaporates, add 2 teaspoons of soy sauce. Stir and add in 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon minced garlic. Toss the butter with the mushrooms until fragrant, about 1 minute, then return the beef to the wok. Cook, stirring, until beef is cooked through, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a serving platter immediately and serve.
