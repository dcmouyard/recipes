# Char Siu

★★★★★

Serves: 6
Time: 3 hours (plus overnight marinade)

## Ingredients

- 4 pounds boneless pork butt
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup (7 ounces) sugar
- ¾ cup hoisin sauce
- ½ cup Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- ¼ cup grated fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 teaspoons five-spice powder
- ½ teaspoon ground white pepper
- ¾ cup honey

## Instructions

1. Cut pork into 4 pieces and butterfly to create ¾-inch-thick pieces. Divide pork between 2 one-gallon zipper-lock bags.

2. Whisk 1 cup soy sauce, 1 cup sugar, ¾ cup hoisin sauce, ½ cup Shaoxing wine, ¼ cup grated fresh ginger, 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, 4 minced garlic cloves, 2 teaspoons five-spice powder, and ½ teaspoon ground pepper together in large bowl. Measure out 1 cup marinade and set aside.

3. Divide equally between bags and rub to distribute evenly over pork. Press out as much air as possible from bags and seal; refrigerate pork for at least 10 hours or up to 16 hours.

4. While pork marinates, whisk ¾ cup honey and 1 cup reserved marinade together in medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until glaze is reduced to 1 cup, 4 to 6 minutes. (Glaze can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)

5. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and set wire rack in sheet. Spray rack with vegetable oil spray.

6. Remove pork from marinade, letting excess drip off, and place on prepared rack. Cover sheet tightly with aluminum foil, crimping edges to seal. Bake until pork registers 195 degrees, 2 to 2½ hours.

7. Remove pork from oven and discard foil. Let pork rest on rack for 30 minutes.

8. Heat broiler. Brush both sides of pork with half of remaining glaze; broil until top is mahogany, 2 to 6 minutes.

9. Flip pork and broil until second side is mahogany, 2 to 6 minutes.

10. Brush both sides with remaining glaze and continue to broil until top is dark mahogany and lightly charred, 2 to 6 minutes longer (second side does not get broiled again).

11. Transfer pork to carving board, charred side up, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice pork crosswise into ½-inch-thick strips and serve.
