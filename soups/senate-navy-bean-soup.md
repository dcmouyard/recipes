# Senate Navy Bean Soup

★★★☆☆

Serves: 6-8
Time: 3 hours

## Ingredients

* Salt and pepper
* 1 pound (2½ cups) navy beans, picked over and rinsed
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 onion, chopped fine
* 2 celery ribs, chopped fine
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 3 whole cloves
* 2 (12-ounce) smoked ham hocks
* 8 ounces russet potatoes, peeled and cut into ¼-inch pieces
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 4 quarts cold water in large container. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.

2. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, celery, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook until softened, 8 to 10 minutes.

3. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion mixture to bowl.

4. Insert cloves into skin of 1 ham hock. Add 8 cups water, ham hocks, and beans to now-empty pot and bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered with lid slightly ajar, until beans are tender, 45 to 60 minutes, stirring occasionally.

5. Stir potatoes and onion mixture into soup and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.

6. Remove pot from heat. Transfer ham hocks to cutting board and let cool slightly. Discard cloves, then shred meat, discarding bones and skin.

7. Using potato masher, gently mash beans and potatoes until soup is creamy and lightly thickened, 8 to 10 strokes. Add ½ teaspoon pepper and shredded meat and return to simmer over medium heat. Stir in vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
