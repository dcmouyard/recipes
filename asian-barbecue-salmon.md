# Asian Barbecue Salmon

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon light brown sugar
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ teaspoon cornstarch
* 4 center-cut skin-on salmon fillets, 6 to 8 ounces each
* Ground black pepper
* 1 teaspoon vegetable oil

### Asian Barbecue Glaze

* 2 tablespoons ketchup
* 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
* 2 teaspoons Asian chili-garlic sauce
* 1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine 1 teaspoon brown sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon cornstarch in small bowl. Pat salmon dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture evenly over top of flesh side of salmon, rubbing to distribute.

2. Whisk glaze ingredients together in small saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat; simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.

3. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Place salmon, flesh side down, in skillet and cook until well browned, about 1 minute. Using tongs, carefully flip salmon and cook on skin side for 1 minute.

4. Remove skillet from heat and spoon glaze evenly over salmon fillets. Transfer skillet to oven and cook until center of thickest part of fillets registers 125 degrees on instant-read thermometer and is still translucent when cut into with paring knife, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer fillets to platter or individual plates and serve.
