# Pork Lo Mein

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 2 hours

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- ¼ teaspoon five-spice powder
- 1 pound boneless country-style pork ribs, trimmed of surface fat and excess gristle and sliced crosswise into ⅛-inch pieces
- ¼ teaspoon liquid smoke
- ½ cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
- 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
- 4½ teaspoons vegetable oil
- 4 tablespoons Chinese rice cooking wine (Shao-Xing) or dry sherry
- ½ pound shiitake mushrooms, stems trimmed, caps cut in halves or thirds (about 3 cups)
- 2 bunches scallions, whites thinly sliced and greens cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 cups)
- 1 small head Napa or Chinese cabbage, halved, cored, and sliced crosswise into ½-inch strips (about 4 cups)
- 12 ounces Chinese egg noodles
- 1 tablespoon Asian chile garlic sauce

## Instructions

1. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven over high heat.

2. Whisk 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and ¼ teaspoon five-spice powder together in medium bowl. Place 3 tablespoons soy sauce mixture in large zipper-lock bag; add pork and liquid smoke, if using. Press out as much air as possible and seal bag, making sure that all pieces are coated with marinade. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.

3. Whisk ½ cup broth and 1 teaspoon cornstarch into remaining soy sauce mixture in medium bowl. In separate small bowl, mix garlic and ginger with ½ teaspoon vegetable oil; set aside.

4. Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in 12-inch cast-iron or nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add half of pork in single layer, breaking up clumps with wooden spoon. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons wine to skillet; cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is reduced and pork is well coated, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer pork to medium bowl and repeat with remaining pork, 1 teaspoon oil, and remaining 2 tablespoons wine. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.

5. Return skillet to high heat, add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, and heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Add scallions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are wilted, 2 to 3 minutes longer.

6. Add garlic-ginger mixture and cook, mashing mixture with spoon, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return pork-vegetable mixture and chicken broth-soy mixture to skillet; simmer until thickened and ingredients are well incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.

7. Stir noodles into boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender. Drain noodles and transfer back to Dutch oven; add cooked stir-fry mixture and garlic-chili sauce, tossing noodles constantly, until sauce coats noodles. Serve immediately.
