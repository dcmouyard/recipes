# Irish Soda Bread

★★★★★

Serves: 1 loaf
Time: 85 minutes

You can replace the cake flour with all-purpose flour, but the bread will be much heavier with an overly thick crust.

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cake flour
- 1½ teaspoons baking soda
- 1½ teaspoons cream of tartar
- 1½ teaspoons salt
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 1½ cups low-fat buttermilk
- 1 tablespoon melted butter, optional

## Instructions

1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees and adjust a rack to the center position.

2. Place the 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup cake flour, 1½ teaspoons baking soda, 1½ teaspoons cream of tartar, 1½ teaspoons salt, and 2 tablespoons sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and rub it into the flour using your fingers until it is completely incorporated and the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Make a well in the center and add the buttermilk. Work the liquid into the flour mixture using a fork until the dough comes together in large clumps. Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead briefly until the loose flour is just moistened. The dough will still be scrappy and uneven.

4. Form the dough into a round about 6 to 7 inches in diameter and place in a cast iron skillet. Score a deep cross on top of the loaf and place in the heated oven. Bake until nicely browned and a cake tester comes out clean when inserted into the center of the loaf, about 40 to 45 minutes.

5. Remove from oven and brush with a tablespoon of melted butter if desired. Cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature.
