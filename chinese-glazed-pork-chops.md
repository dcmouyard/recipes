# Chinese Glazed Pork Chops

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* 4 bone-in rib or center-cut pork chops
* 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* ¼ cup sugar
* 2 tablespoons orange juice
* 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* ½ teaspoon cornstarch
* ¼ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
* ⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chops and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.

2. Whisk remaining ingredients together in bowl. Pour off fat from skillet, add contents of bowl, and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.

3. Return chops and accumulated juices to skillet. Simmer, turning once or twice, until sauce glazes chops and meat registers 145 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer chops and glaze to platter. Serve.
