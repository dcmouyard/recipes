# Banana Pudding

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* 3 cups half-and-half
* ¾ cup (5¼ ounces) sugar
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 4 large egg yolks
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 3 pieces
* 1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
* 24 Nilla Wafers, plus 4 more for garnish
* 2 large ripe bananas, cut into ¼-inch slices
* 1 cup whipped cream, whipped to soft peaks

## Instructions

1. Place 3 cups half-and-half, ½ cup sugar, and ¼ teaspoon salt in a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring to completely dissolve sugar.

2. Meanwhile, whisk 4 large egg yolks in a medium bowl until thoroughly combined. Whisk in the remaining ¼ cup sugar, and continue whisking until the sugar has begun to dissolve and the mixture is creamy, about 15 seconds.

3. Whisk in 3 tablespoons cornstarch until combined and the mixture is pale yellow and thick, about 30 seconds.

4. When the half-and-half mixture reaches a full simmer, gradually whisk ½ cup of the simmering half-and-half mixture into the yolk mixture to ­temper. Return the egg mixture to the saucepan, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula.

5. Return to a simmer over medium heat, stirring gently but constantly with a wooden spoon until 3 or 4 bubbles burst on the surface and the mixture is thickened and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes.

6. Pass the pudding through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula. Whisk in 3 tablespoons butter and 1½ teaspoons vanilla. Set the pudding aside.

7. Place the Nilla Wafers in a sealed zipper-lock plastic bag and break them into pieces by tapping the cookies with a wooden spoon. Tap only a few times, so that mostly large pieces remain.

8. Gently stir the pudding and then spoon a ­generous ¼ cup pudding into each of four 8-ounce parfait or wine glasses (the pudding will seem too thin—it sets up when refrigerated). Top with several banana slices and then sprinkle with a thin layer of wafer pieces. Repeat once more, ending with a final layer of pudding. Press a piece of plastic wrap dire­ctly on the surface of each pudding and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or overnight.

9. Top each pudding with a dollop of whipped cream and garnish with a whole Nilla Wafer. Serve immediately.
