# Scallops with Lemon Butter

Serves: 4

Use “dry” scallops (those without chemical additives). If you can only find “wet” scallops, soak them in a solution of 1 quart cold water, ¼ cup lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons table salt for 30 minutes before proceeding with step 1. In step 4, season the scallops with pepper only. If you are unsure whether your scallops are wet or dry, conduct this quick test: Place 1 scallop on a paper towel-lined, microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power for 15 seconds. If the scallop is “dry,” it will exude very little water. If it is “wet,” there will be a sizable ring of moisture on the paper towel. (The microwaved scallop can be cooked as is.) Prepare the sauce (if serving) while the scallops dry (between steps 1 and 2) and keep it warm while cooking them.

## Ingredients

### Scallops
* 1½ pounds dry sea scallop, 10 to 20 per pound, tendons removed
* Salt and pepper
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* Lemon wedges

### Lemon Butter
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 piece
* 1 small shallot, minced (about 1½ tablespoons)
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves
* ½ teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
* 2 teaspoons juice from 1 lemon
* Table salt and ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Place scallops on rimmed baking sheet lined with clean dish towel. Place second clean dish towel on top of scallops and press gently on towel to blot liquid. Let scallops sit at room temperature for 10 minutes while towels absorb moisture.

2. Heat 4 tablespoons butter in small heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat; cook, swirling pan constantly, until butter turns dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 4 to 5 minutes.

3. Add shallot and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat and stir in parsley, thyme, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.

4. Sprinkle scallops on both sides with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Add half of scallops in single layer, flat side down, and cook, without moving them, until well browned, 1½ to 2 minutes.

5. Add 1 tablespoon butter to skillet. Using tongs, flip scallops; continue to cook, using large spoon to baste scallops with melted butter (tilt skillet so butter runs to 1 side) until sides of scallops are firm and centers are opaque and register 115 degrees, 30 to 90 seconds longer (remove smaller scallops as they finish cooking).

6. Transfer scallops to large plate and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Wipe out skillet with paper towels and repeat with remaining oil, scallops, and butter. Serve immediately with lemon wedges and sauce.
