# Red Beans and Rice

Serves: 6-8
Time: 225 minutes

## Ingredients

* Table salt
* 1 pound small red beans (about 2 cups), rinsed and picked over
* 4 slices bacon (about 4 ounces), chopped fine (see note)
* 1 medium onion, chopped fine (about 1 cup)
* 1 small green bell pepper, seeded and chopped fine (about ½ cup)
* 1 celery rib, chopped fine (about ½ cup)
* 3 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)
* 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
* 1 teaspoon sweet paprika
* 2 bay leaves
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* Ground black pepper
* 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 6 cups water
* 8 ounces andouille sausage, halved lengthwise and cut into ¼-inch slices (or kielbasa)
* 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar, plus extra for seasoning
* 3 scallions, white and green parts, sliced thin
* Hot sauce (optional)

## Instructions

1. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 4 quarts cold water in large bowl or container. Add beans and soak at room temperature for at least 8 hours and up to 24 hours. Drain and rinse well.

2. Heat bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and almost fully rendered, 5 to 8 minutes.

3. Add onion, green pepper, and celery; cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, 6 to 7 minutes.

4. Stir in garlic, 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon paprika, 2 bay leaves, ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

5. Stir in beans, 3 cups broth, and 6 cups water; bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat and vigorously simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are just soft and liquid begins to thicken, 45 to 60 minutes.

6. Stir in sausage and 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar and cook until liquid is thick and beans are fully tender and creamy, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt, black pepper, and additional red wine vinegar. Serve over rice, sprinkling with scallions and passing hot sauce separately, if desired.
