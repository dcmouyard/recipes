# Candied Sweet Potatoes

★★★★☆

Serves: 10-12

For a more intense molasses flavor, use dark brown sugar in place of light brown sugar. To make ahead, follow the recipe through step 3. Refrigerate the sweet-potato mixture in a large microwave-safe bowl, tightly wrapped with plastic wrap, for up to 24 hours. When ready to bake, poke several vent holes in the plastic wrap covering the potatoes and microwave on medium-high power until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Continue to assemble and bake the casserole as directed in steps 4 and 5.

## Ingredients

* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, (1 stick), cut into 1-inch chunks
* 5 pounds sweet potatoes, (about 8 medium), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
* 1 cup packed light brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons molasses (optional)
* 1½ teaspoons table salt
* ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
* ½ cup water

### Topping

* 2 cups pecan halves
* ½ cup packed light brown sugar
* 1 egg white, lightly beaten
* ⅛ teaspoon table salt
* Pinch cayenne pepper
* Pinch ground cumin

## Instructions

1. Melt 8 tablespoons butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potatoes, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons molasses, 1½ teaspoons salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and 1½ cup water; bring to a simmer.

2. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring often, until the sweet potatoes are tender (a paring knife can be slipped into and out of the center of the potatoes with very little resistance), 45 to 60 minutes.

3. When the sweet potatoes are tender, remove the lid and bring the sauce to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat. Continue to simmer until the sauce has reduced to a glaze, 7 to 10 minutes.

4. For the Topping: Meanwhile, mix all the ingredients for the topping together in a medium bowl; set aside.

5. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Pour the potato mixture into a 13 by 9-inch baking dish (or a shallow casserole dish of similar size). Spread the topping over the potatoes. Bake until the pecans are toasted and crisp, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
