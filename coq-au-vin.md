# Coq au Vin

★★★★★

Serves: 5-7
Time: 2½ hours

Goes well with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

## Ingredients

* 1 bottle medium-bodied, fruity red wine such as Pinot Noir or Rhône Valley Grenache.
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 10 sprigs fresh parsley leaves
* 2 sprigs fresh thyme (or ¼ teaspoon dried thyme)
* 1 bay leaf
* 4 ounces bacon, preferably thick-cut, cut crosswise into ¼-inch pieces
* 2½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat and cut in half crosswise
* Salt and ground black pepper
* 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 24 frozen pearl onions, thawed, drained, and patted dry (about 1 cup)
* 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, wiped clean, stems trimmed, halved if small and quartered if large
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Bring all but 1 tablespoon wine (reserve for later use), broth, parsley sprigs, thyme, and bay to simmer in large saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook until reduced to 3 cups, about 25 minutes. Discard herbs.

2. Meanwhile, cook bacon in large Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, 7 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer bacon to paper-towel-lined plate. Reserve 4 tablespoons fat in small bowl; discard remaining fat.

3. Lightly season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons reserved bacon fat in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add half of chicken in single layer and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining chicken and 2 tablespoons bacon fat.

4. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When foaming subsides, add pearl onions and mushrooms; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes.

5. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

6. Add tomato paste and flour; cook, stirring frequently, until well combined, about 1 minute.

7. Add reduced wine mixture, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits; add ¼ teaspoon pepper. Return chicken, any accumulated juices, and reserved bacon to pot; increase heat to high and bring to boil.

8. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover pot, and simmer until chicken is tender, about 25 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking time.

9. Using slotted spoon, transfer chicken to large bowl; tent with foil to keep warm.

10. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer sauce until thick and glossy and measures 3 cups, about 5 minutes.

11. Off heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter and reserved 1 tablespoon wine. Season to taste with salt. Return chicken to pot and top with minced parsley. Serve immediately.
