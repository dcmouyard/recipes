# Noodle Cake with Stir-fried Chicken and Bok Choy

Serves: 4

## Ingredients

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, (about 1¼ pounds), trimmed of excess fat, tenderloins removed and halved lengthwise, breasts cut crosswise into ½-inch strips
* 2½ tablespoons soy sauce
* 2½ tablespoons dry sherry
* ¼ cup hoisin sauce
* 1 tablespoon Asian chile garlic sauce
* 12 ounces Chinese egg noodles, (fresh), about the thickness of spaghetti
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 4 thin-sliced scallions, white and light green parts sliced thin, dark green parts sliced thin on the bias for garnish
* 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 large head bok choy, (about 1 pound), stalks and greens separated, stalks cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices and greens cut into ½-inch strips
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger

## Instructions

1. Bring 3 quarts water to boil over high heat in stockpot. Meanwhile, combine chicken, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon sherry in small bowl; set aside to marinate.

2. Mix together ¼ cup hoisin, 1 tablespoon garlic chili sauce, and remaining 1½ tablespoons each soy sauce and sherry in small bowl; set aside while preparing noodles.

3. Add noodles and 1 teaspoon salt to boiling water; cook noodles until just tender (do not overcook), 2 to 3 minutes. Drain thoroughly, then toss with white and light green parts of scallions.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Spread noodles evenly across bottom of skillet; press with spatula to flatten and cook until crisp and golden brown, about 4 minutes.

5. Slide noodle cake onto large plate. Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet; swirl to coat. Invert noodle cake onto second plate and slide it, browned-side up, back into skillet. Cook until golden brown on second side, about 4 minutes. Slide noodle cake onto cutting board; set aside.

6. Add 1 tablespoon oil to skillet; heat oil over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Pour off excess liquid from chicken and add chicken to skillet; stir-fry until just cooked, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to small clean bowl.

7. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet; heat oil over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Add bok choy stalks and stir-fry 1 minute.

8. Clear center of pan, add ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 10 seconds, then stir ginger into stalks; continue to stir-fry until stalks are tender-crisp, about 20 seconds longer.

9. Stir in bok choy greens, chicken, and hoisin mixture; cook until greens are wilted and ingredients are coated with sauce, about 30 seconds. Set skillet aside off heat.

10. Cut noodle cake into 8 wedges. Place 2 wedges on each of 4 plates; spoon portion of stir-fry and sauce over noodle cake, sprinkle with scallion greens, and serve immediately.
