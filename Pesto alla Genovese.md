# Pesto alla Genovese

★★★★☆

Serves: 6 (Makes ¾ cup, enough for 1 pound of pasta)
Time: 30 minutes

The pesto can be kept in an airtight container, covered with a thin layer of oil (1 to 2 tablespoons), and refrigerated for up to four days or frozen for up to one month.

## Ingredients

- ¼ cup pine nuts, toasted (or substitute almonds or walnuts)
- 3 garlic cloves, unpeeled
- 2 cups packed fresh basil leaves (~ 1.25oz / 37.4g)
- 7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ cup finely grated parmesan cheese or Pecorino Romano

## Instructions

1. Toast ¼ cup nuts in a small, heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until just golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes; set aside.

2. Add 3 unpeeled garlic cloves to the empty skillet and toast over medium heat, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant and the color of the cloves deepens slightly, about 7 minutes. Let the garlic cool slightly, then peel, and chop.

3. Place the basil in a heavy-duty 1-gallon zipper-lock plastic bag. Pound the bag with the flat side of a meat pounder or rolling pin until all the leaves are bruised.

4. Process the nuts, garlic, basil, 7 tablespoons olive oil, and ½ teaspoon salt in a food processor until smooth, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides of the bowl, about 1 minute.

5. Stir in ¼ cup grated cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste.
