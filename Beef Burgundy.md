## Ingredients

### Beef Braise

- 4-4¼ pounds beef chuck roast
- 6 ounces salt pork, trimmed of rind (see Step 1 below), rind reserved, and salt pork cut into 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch by 1-inch pieces
- 10 sprigs fresh parsley leaves, torn into quarters
- 6 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 medium onions, chopped coarse
- 2 medium carrots, chopped coarse
- 1 medium head garlic, cloves separated and crushed but unpeeled
- 2 bay leaves, crumbled
- ½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- ½ ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed (optional)
- Salt and ground black pepper
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
- ⅓ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1¾ cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 bottle red burgundy wine, (750 ml) or Pinot Noir
- 1 teaspoon tomato paste

### Onion and Mushroom Garnish

- 36 frozen pearl onions, (about 7 ounces)
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- ½ teaspoon table salt
- 10 ounces white mushrooms, whole if small, halved if medium, quartered if large
- 2 tablespoons brandy
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Pull apart the roast at its major seams (delineated by lines of fat and silver skin). With a paring knife, trim off all visible fat and silver skin. Cut the meat into large chunks measuring about 1½ to 2 inches.

2. Bring salt pork, reserved salt pork rind, and 3 cups water to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Boil 2 minutes, then drain well.

3. Cut two 22-inch lengths of cheesecloth and unfold each piece once lengthwise so that each forms a 2-ply, 22 by 8-inch piece. Lay the cheesecloth in a medium bowl, stacking the sheets. Place parsley, thyme, onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, porcini mushrooms, and blanched salt pork rind in the cheesecloth-lined bowl. Gather the edges of the cheesecloth securely and fasten with kitchen twine. Trim excess cheesecloth with scissors if necessary and set in 8-quart nonreactive Dutch oven. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.

4. Set 12-inch skillet with salt pork over medium heat; sauté until lightly brown and crisp, about 12 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon to Dutch oven; pour off all but 2 teaspoons fat and reserve.

5. Season beef with salt and pepper. Increase heat to high and brown half of beef in single layer, turning once or twice, until deep brown, about 7 minutes; transfer browned beef to Dutch oven.

6. Pour ½ cup water into skillet and scrape pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits; when pan bottom is clean, pour liquid into Dutch oven.

7. Return skillet to high heat and add 2 teaspoons reserved pork fat; swirl to coat pan bottom. When fat begins to smoke, brown remaining beef in single layer, turning once or twice, until deep brown, about 7 minutes; transfer browned beef to Dutch oven.

8. Pour ½ cup water into skillet and scrape pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits; when pan bottom is clean, pour liquid into Dutch oven.

9. Set now-empty skillet over medium heat; add butter. When foaming subsides, whisk in flour until evenly moistened and pasty. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture has toasty aroma and resembles light-colored peanut butter, about 5 minutes.

10. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and 1½ cups water; increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer, stirring frequently, until thickened. Pour mixture into Dutch oven.

11. Add 3 cups wine, tomato paste, and salt and pepper to taste to Dutch oven and stir to combine. Set Dutch oven over high heat and bring to boil.

12. Cover and set pot in oven; cook until meat is tender, 2½ to 3 hours.

13. Remove Dutch oven from oven and, using tongs, transfer vegetable and herb bouquet to strainer set over pot. Press out liquid into pot and discard bouquet.

14. With slotted spoon, remove beef to medium bowl; set aside. Allow braising liquid to settle about 15 minutes, then, with wide shallow spoon, skim fat off surface and discard.

15. Bring liquid in Dutch oven to boil over medium-high heat. Simmer briskly, stirring occasionally to ensure that bottom is not burning, until sauce is reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, 15 to 25 minutes.

16. While sauce is reducing, bring pearl onions, butter, sugar, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ½ cup water to boil in medium skillet over high heat; cover and reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, shaking pan occasionally, until onions are tender, about 5 minutes.

17. Uncover, increase heat to high, and simmer until all liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes.

18. Add mushrooms and ¼ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid released by mushrooms evaporates and vegetables are browned and glazed, about 5 minutes.

19. Transfer vegetables to large plate and set aside. Add ¼ cup water to skillet and stir with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. When pan bottom and sides are clean, add liquid to reducing sauce.

20. When sauce has reduced to about 3 cups and thickened to the consistency of heavy cream, reduce heat to medium-low; stir in beef, mushrooms and onions (and any accumulated juices), remaining wine from bottle, and brandy into Dutch oven. Cover pot and cook until just heated through, 5 to 8 minutes.

21. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve, sprinkling individual servings with minced parsley.
