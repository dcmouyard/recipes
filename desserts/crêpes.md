# Crêpes

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 45 minutes

Crêpes will give off steam as they cook, but if at any point the skillet begins to smoke, remove it from the heat immediately and turn down the heat. Stacking the crêpes on a wire rack allows excess steam to escape so they won’t stick together. To allow for practice, the recipe yields 10 crêpes; only eight are needed for the filling.

## Ingredients

* ½ teaspoon vegetable oil
* 1 cup (5 ounces) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* ¼ teaspoon table salt
* 1½ cups whole milk
* 3 large eggs
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

### Lemon filling
* 8 teaspoons sugar
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges

### Honey

## Instructions

1. Place ½ teaspoon vegetable oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet and heat over low heat for at least 10 minutes.

2. While skillet is heating, whisk together 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon sugar, and ¼ teaspoon salt in medium bowl. In separate bowl, whisk together 1½ cups milk and 3 eggs. Add half of milk mixture to dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Add 2 tablespoons butter and whisk until incorporated. Whisk in remaining milk mixture until smooth.

3. Using paper towel, wipe out skillet, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides. Increase heat to medium and let skillet heat for 1 minute. After 1 minute, test heat of skillet by placing 1 teaspoon batter in center and cook for 20 seconds. If mini crêpe is golden brown on bottom, skillet is properly heated; if it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly and retest.

4. Pour ½ cup batter into far side of pan and tilt and shake gently until batter evenly covers bottom of pan. Cook crêpe without moving it until top surface is dry and crêpe starts to brown at edges, loosening crêpe from side of pan with rubber spatula, about 25 seconds.

5. Gently slide spatula underneath edge of crêpe, grasp edge with fingertips, and flip crêpe. Cook until second side is lightly spotted, about 20 seconds.

6. Transfer cooked crêpe to wire rack, inverting so spotted side is facing up. Return pan to heat and heat for 10 seconds before repeating with remaining batter. As crêpes are done, stack on wire rack.

7. Transfer stack of crêpes to large microwave-safe plate and invert second plate over crêpes. Microwave on high power until crêpes are warm, 30 to 45 seconds (45 to 60 seconds if crêpes have cooled completely). Remove top plate and wipe dry with paper towel.

8. Drizzle 1 teaspoon sugar or honey and other fillings over top half of each crêpe. Fold bottom half over filled half, then fold into quarters. Serve immediately.
