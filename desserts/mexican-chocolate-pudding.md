# Mexican Chocolate Pudding

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 30 minutes

Try less cinnamon next time.

## Ingredients

* 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
* 2 tablespoons cocoa
* 2½ tablespoons cornstarch
* ½ cup sugar
* ⅛ teaspoon table salt
* 2 teaspoons espresso powder, or instant coffee
* ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 2½ cups whole milk
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Melt chocolate over double boiler or in microwave. Cool slightly.

2. Whisk together 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 2½ tablespoons cornstarch, ½ cup sugar, ⅛ teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons espresso powder, and ½ teaspoon cinnamon in heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Add 2½ cups milk all at once and whisk to incorporate. Whisk in melted chocolate.

3. Bring mixture to boil over medium heat, whisking until smooth. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly with heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon and making sure to scrape edges of pan, for 2 minutes. (Mixture will become thick and glossy.)

4. Remove pan from heat and stir in 2 teaspoons vanilla. Pour pudding through fine-mesh strainer and into heatproof bowl, pushing gently with spatula or spoon and leaving any solids in strainer. Place plastic wrap directly on surface of pudding to prevent skin from forming. Refrigerate for 4 hours or until completely chilled. (Pudding will keep for up to 2 days.) Gently stir pudding before transferring to individual bowls and serving.
