# Hawaiian Sweet Rolls

Makes: 18 rolls
Time: 4 hours

## Ingredients

* 1 cup canned pineapple juice (not fresh)
* ½ cup whole milk
* 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus 2 tablespoons softened
* ⅓ cup mild honey (e.g., clover)
* 5½ cups (27½ ounces / 780 grams) all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon instant or rapid-rise yeast (or 1¼ tablespoons active dry yeast)
* 2½ teaspoons salt
* 1 large egg
* 2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Grease large bowl and 13 by 9-inch baking dish.

2. Combine 1 cup pineapple juice, ½ cup milk, 6 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, and ⅓ cup honey in 4-cup liquid measuring cup and microwave until mixture registers 110 degrees, about 1 minute. (Mixture may appear curdled.)

3. Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix 5½ cups flour, 1 tablespoon instant yeast, and 2½ teaspoons salt on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds.

4. Slowly add pineapple juice mixture, followed by 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons vinegar, and 2 teaspoons vanilla and knead until cohesive mass starts to form, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and mix until dough is elastic and pulls away from sides of bowl but still sticks to bottom (dough will be sticky), 5 to 7 minutes.

5. Turn dough onto lightly floured counter and knead briefly to form smooth, cohesive ball. Transfer dough to prepared bowl and turn to coat with grease. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size and fingertip depression in dough springs back slowly, 1 to 1½ hours.

6. Gently press down on center of dough to deflate. Place dough on clean counter and divide into thirds. Cut each third into 6 equal pieces (about 2¾ ounces or 78 grams per piece). Form each piece into rough ball by pinching and pulling dough edges under so that top is smooth. On counter, cup each ball with your palm and roll in circular motion into smooth, tight ball.

7. Arrange into 6 rows of 3 in prepared dish and cover loosely with plastic. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 1 to 1½ hours (rolls should almost reach top of dish and edges should be touching).

8. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees.

9. Remove plastic, transfer rolls to oven, and bake until deep golden brown and centers register 205 to 210 degrees, about 25 minutes, rotating dish halfway through baking.

10. Let rolls cool in dish on wire rack for 10 minutes. Using spatula, slide rolls out onto wire rack, brush with softened butter, and let cool for 20 minutes. Serve warm.

11. (To reheat room-temperature rolls, wrap in aluminum foil, place on baking sheet, and bake in 350-degree oven for 20 minutes.)
