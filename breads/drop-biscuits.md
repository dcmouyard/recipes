★★★★★

Makes: 12
Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, (10 ounces)
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* ¾ teaspoon table salt
* 1 cup buttermilk, (cold)
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly (about 5 minutes), plus 2 tablespoons melted butter for brushing biscuits

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475 degrees.

2. Whisk 2 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon sugar, and ¾ teaspoon salt in large bowl.

3. Combine buttermilk and 8 tablespoons melted butter in medium bowl, stirring until butter forms small clumps.

4. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and stir with rubber spatula until just incorporated and batter pulls away from sides of bowl.

5. Using greased ¼-cup dry measure, scoop level amount of batter and drop onto parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet (biscuits should measure about 2¼ inches in diameter and 1¼ inches high). Repeat with remaining batter, spacing biscuits about 1½ inches apart. Bake until tops are golden brown and crisp, 12 to 14 minutes.

6. Brush biscuit tops with remaining 2 tablespoons melted butter. Transfer to wire rack and let cool 5 minutes before serving.
