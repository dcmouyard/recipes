# Garlic Fried Rice

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

* 5 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 8 garlic cloves, crushed and sliced thinly
* 4 cups cooked white rice, preferably Jasmine

## Instructions

1. In a small saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic softens, becomes very aromatic, and turns lightly golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer directly into a wok; reserve cooked garlic and set aside.

2. Heat wok over high heat until oil is shimmering. Add rice, breaking up larger clumps with a spatula and tossing to coat with garlic-flavored oil. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until no clumps of rice remain and rice is warmed through, about 4 minutes.

3. Add reserved garlic to rice and toss to combine. Serve immediately.
