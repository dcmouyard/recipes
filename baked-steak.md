## Ingredients

* 4 pounds cube steak
* 1 cup flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3 teaspoons black pepper
* 3 tablespoons vegetable shortening
* 2 tablespoons butter

## Instructions

1. Mix 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and 3 teaspoons black pepper in a bowl.

2. Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper. Dredge each steak in flour mixture, pressing to coat with as much flour as possible.

3. Heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable shortening in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add steaks and flip when sides are deep golden brown. Cook an additional minute on the other side.

4. Transfer steaks to a plate and tent with foil. Set oven to 350 degrees.

5. Add 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour to Dutch oven and scrape bottom with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Cook until mashed, about 2-3 minutes.

6. Add 4 cups of water to Dutch oven and bring to a boil. Stir continually until desired consistency. Add salt/pepper as desired.

7. Add steaks and accumulated juices to Dutch oven and cover. Bake in oven for 1.5 hours.
