# Chili Mac

Serves: 6-8

## Ingredients

* Salt
* ½ pound elbow macaroni (about 2 cups uncooked pasta)
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1½ pounds 85 percent lean ground beef
* 2 medium onions, chopped medium
* 1 red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped medium
* 6 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes
* 1 (28-ounce) can tomato puree
* 1 tablespoon light or dark brown sugar
* 8 ounces Colby Jack cheese, shredded (about 2 ⅔ cups)

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees.

2. Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Stir in 1 tablespoon salt and the macaroni; cook until al dente, about 5 minutes.

3. Reserve ¾ cup of the pasta water and drain the pasta. Transfer the pasta to a bowl and set aside.

4. Wipe the Dutch oven dry. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and return to medium-high heat until shimmering.

5. Add the beef and cook, breaking up the pieces with a wooden spoon, until it is no longer pink and beginning to brown, 5 to 8 minutes.

6. Drain the beef through a colander, discarding the drippings, and set it aside.

7. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the Dutch oven and return to medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions, red pepper, garlic, chili powder, and cumin; cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and beginning to brown, about 7 minutes.

8. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato puree, brown sugar, the reserved pasta water, and the drained beef; bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors have melded, about 20 minutes.

9. Stir in the cooked pasta and season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour into a 9 by 13-inch baking dish (or a shallow casserole dish of similar size) and sprinkle with the cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted and browned, about 15 minutes. Cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
