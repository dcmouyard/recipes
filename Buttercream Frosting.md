# Buttercream Frosting

Makes: 4 cups
This buttercream can be refrigerated for up to 5 days; let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes before using.

## Ingredients

- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup (7 ounces / 198 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- Pinch table salt
- 1 pound (454 grams) unsalted butter (4 sticks), softened, each stick cut into quarters

## Instructions

1. Combine 4 eggs, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and a pinch of salt in bowl of standing mixer; place bowl over pan of simmering water. Whisking gently but constantly, heat mixture until thin and foamy and registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer.

2. Beat egg mixture on medium-high speed with whisk attachment until light, airy, and cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes. (The bottom of the mixer bowl should feel cool to the touch.)

3. Reduce speed to medium and add 1 pound softened unsalted butter, one piece at a time. (After adding half the butter, buttercream may look curdled; it will smooth with additional butter.) Once all butter is added, increase speed to high and beat 1 minute until light, fluffy, and thoroughly combined.
