# Bacon

★★★★☆

Serves: 4

Use a large, rimmed baking sheet, such as a jelly-roll pan, that is shallow enough to promote browning, yet tall enough (at least 3/4-inch in height) to contain the rendered bacon fat. To save time, you can add the bacon to the oven before it reaches 400 degrees, but exact cooking time will vary from oven to oven. If cooking more than one tray of bacon, exchange their oven positions once about halfway through the cooking process.

## Ingredients

* 12 slices bacon, thin- or thick-cut

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees.

2. Arrange bacon slices in a large jelly-roll pan or other shallow baking pan. Roast until fat begins to render, 5 to 6 minutes.

3. Rotate the pan front-to-back. Continue roasting until is crisp and brown, 5 to 6 minutes longer for thin-sliced bacon, 5 to 8 minutes for thick-cut.

4. Transfer with tongs to paper towel-lined plate, drain, and serve.

## Notes

* 5 minutes, then 8 minutes was a little too long for thick bacon. (too crispy)
