# Banana Bread

Makes: 1 loaf

## Ingredients

- 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon table salt
- 3 very ripe bananas, soft, darkly speckled, mashed well (about 1½ cups)
- ¼ cup plain yogurt
- 2 large eggs, beaten lightly
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease bottom only of regular loaf pan, or grease and flour bottom and sides of nonstick 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan; set aside.

2. Combine 2 cups flour, ¾ cup sugar, ¾ teaspoon baking soda, and ½ teaspoon table salt in large bowl; set aside.

3. Mix mashed bananas, ¼ cup yogurt, 2 eggs, 6 tablespoons butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla with wooden spoon in medium bowl.

4. Lightly fold banana mixture into dry ingredients with rubber spatula until just combined and batter looks thick and chunky. Scrape batter into prepared loaf pan; bake until loaf is golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.
