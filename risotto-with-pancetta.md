# Risotto with Pancetta

★★★★☆

When the rice is done, stir in a little extra liquid as the sauce will set up a bit when served. If you have it on hand, use 5 cups of homemade chicken broth (at room temperature) instead of the water/canned broth combination.

Serves: 4-6
Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, peeled and diced
* 2-4 ounces pancetta, country ham, proscuitto, or other flavorful cured meat, minced
* 2 cups Arborio rice, or medium grain rice
* Table salt
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, combined with 3 cups water
* ½ cup dry white wine
* ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or grated Asiago, plus extra for passing

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a heavy pot, 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Add onions and ham; sauté, stirring occastionally, until onions soften, 3 to 5 minutes.

2. Stir in rice and 1 teaspoon salt or to taste. Add 3 cups of the broth/water mixture and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pan bottom is dry when rice is pulled back with spoon, 8 to 10 minutes.

3. Add wine, stirring frequently until absorbed. Then add ½ cup of the broth/water mixture at a time, stirring constantly until each addition is absorbed; cook until rice is creamy but still somewhat firm in center (add more water in ½ cup increments if broth/water mixture runs out), 10 to 12 minutes longer.

4. Stir in cheese. Serve on a wide platter or individual plates with additional cheese passed separately.
