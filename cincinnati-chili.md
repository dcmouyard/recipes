# Cincinnati Chili

★★★★★

Serves: 6-8
Time: 2 hours

## Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons table salt or more to taste
* 2 pounds ground beef chuck (90% lean if possible)
* 2 tablespoons bacon grease
* 2 medium onions, chopped fine (about 2 cups)
* 5 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 5 teaspoons)
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* 2 teaspoons cocoa
* 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon ground chipotle powder (optional)
* ½ teaspoon ground allspice
* ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 cups strong decaffeinated coffee
* 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
* 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
* 15 ounces tomato sauce
* 2 teaspoons beef bouillon
* 1 tablespoon Gravy Master
* 1 tablespoon liquid smoke

## Instructions

1. Bring 2 quarts of water and 1 teaspoon of the salt to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the ground chuck, stirring vigorously to separate the meat into individual strands. As soon as the foam from the meat rises to the top (this takes about 30 seconds) and before the water returns to a boil, drain the meat into a strainer and set it aside.

2. Rinse and dry the empty saucepan. Set the pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons bacon grease. When the grease is warm, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and browned around the edges, about 8 minutes.

3. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

4. Stir in 2 tablespoons chili powder, 2 teaspoons oregano, 2 teaspoons cocoa, 1½ teaspoons cinnamon, ½ teaspoon chipotle powder, ½ teaspoon allspice, ¼ teaspoon black pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant, about 30 seconds.

5. Stir in 2 cups chicken broth, 2 cups coffee, 2 tablespoons cider vinegar, 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar, 15 ounces tomato sauce, 2 teaspoons beef bouillon, 1 tablespoon Gravy Master, and 1 tablespoon liquid smoke, scraping the pan bottom to remove any browned bits.

6. Add the blanched ground beef and increase the heat to high. As soon as the liquid boils, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chili is deep red and has thickened slightly, about 1 hour. (The chili can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat before serving.)

7. Best served with spaghetti, shredded cheddar cheese, dark kidney beans, diced onions, and oyster crackers.
