# Cincinnati Chili

Use canned tomato sauce for this recipe—do not use jarred spaghetti sauce.

Serves: 6-8

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 2 onions, chopped fine
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
* Salt
* ¾ teaspoon ground black pepper
* ¼ teaspoon allspice
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 cups tomato sauce
* 2 tablespoons cider vinegar
* 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
* 1½ pounds 85 percent lean ground beef

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook onions until soft and browned around edges, about 8 minutes.

2. Add garlic, tomato paste, chili powder, oregano, cinnamon, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and allspice and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.

3. Stir in chicken broth, tomato sauce, vinegar, and sugar.

2. Add beef and stir to break up meat. Bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chili is deep brown and slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.
