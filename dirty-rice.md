# Dirty Rice

Serves: 4-6

## Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 8 ounces ground pork
* 1 medium onion, chopped fine
* 1 rib celery, chopped fine
* 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped fine
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 ounces chicken livers, rinsed, trimmed of fat, and chopped fine
* ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* Table salt
* 2¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 2 bay leaves
* 1½ cups long grain white rice, rinsed
* 3 scallions, sliced thin

## Instructions

1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add pork and cook until browned, about 5 minutes.

2. Stir in onion, celery, and bell pepper and cook until softened, about 10 minutes.

3. Add garlic, chicken livers, thyme, cayenne, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes.

4. Transfer to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl and cover with foil.

5. Increase heat to high and add chicken broth, bay leaves, and rice to empty pot. Scrape bottom of pot with wooden spoon to remove browned bits. Bring to boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, 15 to 17 minutes.

6. Remove from heat, discard bay leaves, and fluff rice with fork. Gently stir in drained meat and vegetable mixture (discarding any accumulated juices) and sprinkle with scallions. Serve immediately.
