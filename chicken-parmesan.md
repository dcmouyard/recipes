## Ingredients

### Sauce

* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, chopped fine (about 2 cups)
* 8 ounces Italian sausage links
* ⅝ teaspoons dried oregano
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 4 teaspoons)
* 1 (28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
* ⅓ cup beef broth
* ⅛ cup chopped fresh basil leaves

### Chicken

* 2 (6- to 8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (½ cup)
* 2 ounces fontina cheese, shredded (½ cup)
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* 1½ ounces Parmesan cheese, grated (¾ cup)
* ½ cup panko bread crumbs
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder
* ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
* ¼ teaspoon pepper
* ⅓ cup vegetable oil
* ¼ cup torn fresh basil

## Instructions

### Sauce

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees.

2. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add Italian sausages and brown them on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes total. Transfer sausages to plate.

3. Reduce heat to medium, add onions and oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes.

4. Add tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until very dark, about 3 minutes.

5. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

6. Add crushed tomatoes and broth, scraping up any browned bits. Return sausage to pot; bring to simmer, cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until sausages reach 160 degrees.


### Chicken

1. Put thawed chicken in freezer for about 15 minutes.

2. Slice chicken breasts horizontally, then pound the fat ends in between platic wrap to an even thickness of about ½ inch.

1. Sprinkle each side of each cutlet with ⅛ teaspoon salt and let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes.

2. Combine mozzarella and fontina in bowl; set aside.

3. Adjust oven rack 4 inches from broiler element and heat broiler.

4. Whisk egg and flour together in shallow dish or pie plate until smooth.

5. Combine Parmesan, panko, garlic powder, oregano, and pepper in second shallow dish or pie plate.

6. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Working with 1 cutlet at a time, dredge cutlet in egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Coat all sides in Parmesan mixture, pressing gently so crumbs adhere. Transfer cutlet to large plate and repeat with remaining cutlets.

7. Heat vegetable oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully place 2 cutlets in skillet and cook without moving them until bottoms are crispy and deep golden brown, 1½ to 2 minutes.

8. Using tongs, carefully flip cutlets and cook on second side until deep golden brown, 1½ to 2 minutes. Transfer cutlets to paper towel–lined plate and repeat with remaining cutlets.

9. Place cutlets on rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle cheese mixture evenly over cutlets, covering as much surface area as possible. Broil until cheese is melted and beginning to brown, 2 to 4 minutes.

10. Transfer chicken to serving platter and top each cutlet with 2 tablespoons sauce. Sprinkle with basil and serve immediately, passing remaining sauce separately.
