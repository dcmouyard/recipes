# German Buttercream Frosting

## Ingredients

- ¾ cup whole milk
- 4 large egg yolks
- ⅓ cup (2⅓ ounces / 66 grams) granulated sugar
- 1½ teaspoons cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons amaretto (or water)
- 1½ tablespoons instant espresso powder
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions

1. Heat ¾ cup whole milk in small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, whisk 4 egg yolks, ⅓ cup sugar, 1½ teaspoons cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon salt in bowl until smooth. Remove milk from heat and, whisking constantly, add half of milk to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, return tempered yolk mixture to remaining milk in saucepan. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is bubbling and thickens to consistency of warm pudding, 3 to 5 minutes.

2. Transfer pastry cream to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Before using, warm gently to room temperature in microwave at 50 percent power, stirring every 10 seconds.

3. Stir together 2 tablespoons amaretto and 1½ tablespoons espresso powder; set aside.

4. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat 1 cup softened unsalted butter at medium speed until smooth and light, 3 to 4 minutes.

5. Add pastry cream in 3 batches, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Add amaretto mixture and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes longer, scraping down bowl thoroughly halfway through mixing.

6. Combine 4 eggs, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and a pinch of salt in bowl of standing mixer; place bowl over pan of simmering water. Whisking gently but constantly, heat mixture until thin and foamy and registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer.

7. Beat egg mixture on medium-high speed with whisk attachment until light, airy, and cooled to room temperature, about 5 minutes. (The bottom of the mixer bowl should feel cool to the touch.)

8. Reduce speed to medium and add 1 pound softened unsalted butter, one piece at a time. (After adding half the butter, buttercream may look curdled; it will smooth with additional butter.) Once all butter is added, increase speed to high and beat 1 minute until light, fluffy, and thoroughly combined.
