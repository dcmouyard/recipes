# Steak with Mushroom Sauce

★★★★★

Serves: 4
Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

* 4 8-ounce filet mignon steaks, (1½-1¾ inches thick)
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 8 ounces button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin (about 3 cups)
* 1 small shallot, minced (about 1½ tablespoons)
* 1 cup dry red wine
* ½ cup low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees.

2. Pat steaks dry with paper towel. Season entire surface of steaks liberally with salt and pepper; gently press sides of steaks until uniform 1½ inches thick.

3. Place steaks on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet; transfer baking sheet to oven. Cook until instant-read thermometer inserted in center of steak registers 90 to 95 degrees for rare to medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes, or 100 to 105 degrees for medium, 25 to 30 minutes.

4. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat until smoking. Place steaks in skillet and sear steaks until well-browned and crusty, about 1½ to 2 minutes, lifting once halfway through to redistribute fat underneath each steak. (Reduce heat if fond begins to burn.)

5. Using tongs, turn steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 2 to 2½ minutes.

6. Transfer all steaks to wire cooling rack and reduce heat under pan to medium. Use tongs to stand 2 steaks on their sides. Holding steaks together, return to skillet and sear on all sides until browned, about 1½ minutes. Repeat with remaining 2 steaks.

7. Transfer steaks to wire cooling rack and let rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10 minutes while preparing pan sauce.

8. Pour off any fat from skillet in which steaks were cooked. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown and liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes.

9. Add shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to soften, about 1 minute.

10. Increase heat to high; add red wine and broth, scraping bottom of skillet with wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Simmer rapidly until liquid and mushrooms are reduced to 1 cup, about 6 minutes.

11. Add vinegar, mustard, and any juices from resting steaks; cook until thickened, about 1 minute.

12. Off heat, whisk in butter and thyme; season with salt and pepper to taste.

13. Arrange steaks on individual plates and spoon sauce over steaks; serve immediately.
