# Stuffing

Serves: 8

You can substitute 2¼ cups chicken broth and 1½ cups apple cider for the 3¾ cups chicken broth.

## Ingredients

* 1½ pounds baguette, cut into ½-inch cubes (18 cups)
* 3¾ cups chicken broth
* 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 8 ounces bulk pork sausage (optional)
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 2 onions, chopped fine
* 3 celery ribs, minced
* 1½ teaspoons salt
* 1½ tablespoons minced fresh thyme
* 1½ tablespoons minced fresh sage
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* ¾ teaspoon pepper

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Arrange bread evenly on rimmed baking sheet and bake until light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Let bread cool completely.

2. Whisk broth and eggs together in large bowl. Stir bread into broth mixture until evenly coated. Set aside, stirring occasionally, to saturate bread.

3. Cook sausage in cast iron skillet over medium heat, breaking up pieces with spoon, until no longer pink, about 8 minutes. Transfer sausage to bread mixture using slotted spoon; discard fat in skillet and wipe clean with paper towels.

4. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Add onions, celery, and salt and cook until browned, 10 to 12 minutes.

5. Stir in thyme, sage, garlic, and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

6. Stir onion mixture into bread mixture.

7. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in now-empty skillet over low heat. Add stuffing to skillet, pressing down firmly into even layer with spatula (skillet will be very full). Cook until bottom of stuffing is browned around edges when lifted with spatula, 7 to 10 minutes.

8. Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter in microwave and brush evenly over top of stuffing. Transfer skillet to oven and bake until center of stuffing is hot and top is golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Let cool for 10 minutes.
