# Skillet-Roasted Fish Fillets

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients

- 4 skinless white fish fillets, 1 to 1½ inches thick (about 6 to 8 ounces each)
- Salt and pepper
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Lemon wedges

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees.

2. Dry fish thoroughly with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle very light dusting of sugar (about ⅛ teaspoon) evenly over 1 side of each fillet.

3. Heat oil in large ovensafe nonstick skillet over high heat until smoking. Place fillets in skillet, sugared sides down, and press down lightly to ensure even contact with pan. Cook until browned, 1 to 1½ minutes.

4. Using 2 spatulas, flip fillets and transfer skillet to oven. Roast fillets until centers are just opaque and register 135 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately transfer to serving plates and serve with lemon wedges.
