# Ranch Chili

★★★★★

Serves: 4-6
Time: 210 minutes

If not using canned kidney beans, let them soak overnight.

## Ingredients

- 3½ pounds boneless Boston butt roast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch cubes
- 8 slices bacon, chopped fine
- 1 large onion, minced
- 3 large jalapeno chiles (about 2½ inches long), seeded and minced
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1½ teaspoons dried oregano
- 5 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 3 cups water
- 2 (16-ounce) cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed

## Instructions

1. Toss pork cubes with salt and pepper; set aside.

2. Fry bacon in Dutch oven over medium heat until fat renders and bacon crisps, about 10 minutes.

3. Remove bacon with slotted spoon to plate lined with paper towels; pour fat from pot into small bowl; set aside.

4. Increase heat to medium-high, add 2 teaspoona bacon fat and half of meat to now-empty pot and cook until well browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.

5. Transfer browned meat to bowl. Brown remaining meat, adding another 2 teaspoons bacon fat to pot if necessary. Transfer second batch of meat to bowl.

6. Reduce heat to medium-low and add 3 tablespoons bacon fat to now-empty pot. Add onion, jalapeños, chili powder, cumin, and oregano; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are beginning to brown, 4 to 5 minutes.

7. Add garlic and brown sugar; cook until just fragrant, about 15 seconds.

8. Add diced tomatoes and scrape pot bottom to loosen browned bits.

9. Add reserved bacon, browned pork, and water; bring to simmer. Continue to cook, uncovered, at slow simmer until meat is tender and juices are dark and starting to thicken, about 2 hours.

10. Add beans, reduce heat to low, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and serve.
