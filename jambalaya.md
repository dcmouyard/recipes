Serves: 4-6

## Ingredients

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* 5 teaspoons vegetable oil
* ½ pound andouille sausage, halved lengthwise and cut into ¼-inch pieces
* 1 medium onion, chopped medium
* 1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and chopped medium
* 5 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1½ tablespoons)
* 1½ cups long grain white rice
* 1 can (14½ ounces) diced tomatoes, drained
* 1 (8-ounce) bottle clam juice
* 2½ cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 pound large shrimp, (31 to 40 count), peeled, deveined, and rinsed
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Dry the chicken thoroughly with paper towels, then season generously with salt and pepper.

2. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Carefully add the chicken thighs and cook until golden, 4 to 6 minutes.

3. Flip the chicken over and continue to cook until the second side is golden, about 3 minutes.

4. Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the chicken to a plate.

5. Pour off all but 2 teaspoons of the fat left and return to medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the andouille and cook until lightly browned, about 3 minutes, transfer the sausage to a small bowl and set aside.

6. Add the remaining 3 teaspoons oil to the skillet and return to medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, and ½ teaspoon salt; cook, scraping the browned bits off the bottom, until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.

7. Add the rice and cook until the edges turn translucent, about 3 minutes.

8. Stir in the tomatoes, clam juice, and chicken broth; bring to a simmer.

9. Gently nestle the chicken into the rice. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 30 to 35 minutes.

10. Transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Stir the shrimp and sausage into the rice and continue to cook, covered, over low heat for 2 more minutes.

11. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until the shrimp are fully cooked and the rice is tender, about 5 minutes.

12. Shred the chicken using two forks. Stir the parsley and shredded chicken into the rice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.
