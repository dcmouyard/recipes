# Guinness Beef Stew

Serves: 6-8

## Ingredients

* 1 boneless beef chuck roast (3-3½ pounds), trimmed and cut into 1½-inch chunks
* Salt and ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 medium onions, minced
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)
* 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1½ cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 (12-ounce) bottle (about 1½ cups) Guinness Draught
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
* 1½ pounds Red Bliss potatoes (about 5 medium), scrubbed and cut into 1½-inch chunks
* 1 pound carrots, parsnips, or a combination, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves


## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Pat the beef dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add half of the meat and cook, stirring occasionally, until well browned, 7 to 10 minutes, reducing the heat if the pot begins to scorch. Transfer the browned beef to a medium bowl. Repeat with 1 more tablespoon oil and the remaining beef; transfer the meat to the bowl.

3. Add the remaining tablespoon oil to the pot and return to medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 1	tablespoon tomato paste and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 3 tablespoons flour and cook for about 1 minute.

4. Stir in 1½ cups broth and 1¼ cups of the beer, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in the thyme, bay leaves, brown sugar, and browned beef with any accumulated juices. Bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to the oven for 1 hour.

5. Stir the potatoes and carrots into the stew and continue to cook in the oven, covered, until the beef and vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Discard the bay leaves, stir in the remaining ¼ cup beer, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir in the parsley before serving.
