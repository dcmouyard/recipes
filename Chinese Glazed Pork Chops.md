# Chinese Glazed Pork Chops

★★★★☆

Serves: 4
Time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in rib or center-cut pork chops
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- ¼ cup soy sauce
- ¼ cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons orange juice
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ teaspoon cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
- ⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes

## Instructions

1. Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chops and cook until well browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to plate.

2. Whisk remaining ingredients together in bowl. Pour off fat from skillet, add contents of bowl, and simmer until sauce thickens slightly, about 2 minutes.

3. Return chops and accumulated juices to skillet. Simmer, turning once or twice, until sauce glazes chops and meat registers 145 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer chops and glaze to platter. Serve.
