# Baked Fish with Roasted Potatoes

★★☆☆☆

Serves: 6
Time: 2 hours

## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 6 medium garlic cloves, sliced thin
* 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves, or ¼ teaspoon dried
* Salt and ground black pepper
* 2 pounds red potatoes (about 6 medium potatoes), scrubbed and cut into 1-inch chunks
* 1 medium red onion, halved and sliced ¼-inch thick
* 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
* 6 1-inch-thick cod fillets (about 6 ounces each)
* 1½ tablespoons sherry vinegar
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh basil leaves
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges (for serving)

## Instructions

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees.

2. Whisk the oil, garlic, thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, and teaspoon pepper together in a large bowl. Add the potatoes, onion, and tomatoes and toss to coat evenly.

3. Spread the vegetables in a 13 by 9-inch baking dish. Cover tightly with foil and roast until the potatoes have begun to soften, about 15 minutes.

4. Remove the foil and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender and brown in spots, about 45 minutes.

5. Pat the cod fillets dry with paper towels and season them with salt and pepper. Nestle the fish into the roasted vegetables. Continue to bake, uncovered, until the fish just flakes apart, 10 to 15 minutes.

6. Sprinkle with the vinegar and basil and serve with the lemon wedges.
