# Chicken Marsala

Serves: 4

Try this using pork tenderloin medallions pounded thin or veal instead of chicken.

## Ingredients

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, (about 5 ounces each)
* 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
* table salt
* ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2½ ounces pancetta, (about 3 slices), cut into pieces 1 inch long and ⅛ inch wide
* 8 ounces white mushrooms, sliced (about 2 cups)
* 1 medium clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
* 1 teaspoon tomato paste
* 1½ cups marsala wine, (sweet)
* 1½ tablespoons lemon juice, from 1 small lemon
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces, softened
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place large heatproof dinner plate on oven rack, and heat oven to 200 degrees.

2. Heat 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until very hot (you can hold your hand 2 inches above pan surface for 3 to 4 seconds), about 3 minutes.

3. Pat chicken breasts dry. Meanwhile, place flour in shallow baking dish or pie plate. Season both sides of chicken cutlets with salt and pepper; working one piece at a time, coat both sides with flour. Lift breast from tapered end and shake to remove excess flour; set aside.

4. Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil to hot skillet and heat until shimmering. Place floured cutlets in single layer in skillet and cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes.

5. Using tongs, flip cutlets and cook on second side until golden brown and meat feels firm when pressed with finger, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer chicken to heated plate and return plate to oven.

6. Return skillet to low heat and add pancetta; sauté, stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits until pancetta is brown and crisp, about 4 minutes.

7. With slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel--lined plate.

8. Add mushrooms and increase heat to medium-high; sauté, stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom, until liquid released by mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms begin to brown, about 8 minutes.

9. Add garlic, tomato paste, and cooked pancetta; sauté while stirring until tomato paste begins to brown, about 1 minute.

10. Off heat, add Marsala; return pan to high heat and simmer vigorously, scraping browned bits from pan bottom, until sauce is slightly syrupy and reduced to about 1¼ cups, about 5 minutes.

11. Off heat, add lemon juice and any accumulated juices from chicken; whisk in butter 1 tablespoon at a time. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and stir in parsley. Pour sauce over chicken and serve immediately.
