# Chocolate Pots de Crème

Serves: 8

If using a 70 percent bittersweet chocolate, reduce the amount of chocolate to 8 ounces. Covered tightly with plastic wrap, the pots de crème will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator, but the whipped cream must be made just before serving.

## Ingredients

### Pots De Crème

- 10 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine
- 5 large egg yolks
- 5 tablespoons sugar
- ¼ teaspoon table salt
- 1½ cups heavy cream
- ¾ cup half-and-half
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon instant espresso powder, mixed with 1 tablespoon water (or 1 tablespoon strong brewed coffee)

### Whipped Cream

- ½ cup heavy cream, (cold)
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Place chocolate in medium heatproof bowl; set fine-mesh strainer over bowl and set aside.

2. Whisk 5 yolks, 5 tablespoons sugar, and ¼ teaspoon salt in medium bowl until combined; whisk in 1½ cups heavy cream and ¾ cups half-and-half. Transfer mixture to medium saucepan. Cook mixture over medium-low heat, stirring constantly and scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon, until thickened and silky and custard registers 175 to 180 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 8 to 12 minutes. Do not let custard overcook or simmer.

3. Immediately pour custard through strainer over chocolate. Let mixture stand to melt chocolate, about 5 minutes.

4. Whisk gently until smooth, then whisk in 1 tablespoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon espresso. Divide mixture evenly among eight 5-ounce ramekins. Gently tap ramekins against counter to remove air bubbles.

5. Cool pots de crème to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or up to 72 hours. Before serving, let pots de crème stand at room temperature 20 to 30 minutes.

### Whipped Cream

5. Using hand mixer or standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat ½ cup cream, 2 teaspoons sugar, and ½ teaspoon vanilla on low speed until bubbles form, about 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium; continue beating until beaters leave trail, about 30 seconds longer. Increase speed to high; continue beating until nearly doubled in volume and whipped cream forms soft peaks, 30 to 45 seconds longer.

6. Dollop each pot de crème with about 2 tablespoons whipped cream. Serve.
