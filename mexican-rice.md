# Mexican Rice

★★★★★

Serves: 6-8
Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

* 1 can (14½ ounces) diced tomatoes
* 1 medium white onion, minced
* 3 medium jalapeño chiles
* 2 cups long grain white rice
* ⅓ cup canola oil
* 4 cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 4 teaspoons)
* 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 1½ teaspoons table salt
* ½ cup minced fresh cilantro leaves
* 1 lime, cut into wedges for serving

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees.

2. Add onions to liquid measuring cup. Add dice tomatoes until it equals 2 cups.

3. Remove ribs and seeds from 2 jalapeños and discard; mince flesh and set aside. Mince remaining jalapeño, including ribs and seeds; set aside.

4. Place rice in large fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water until water runs clear, about 1½ minutes. Shake rice vigorously in strainer to remove all excess water.

5. Heat ⅓ cup oil in Dutch oven with tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Drop 3 or 4 grains rice in oil; if grains sizzle, oil is ready. Add rice and fry, stirring frequently, until rice is light golden and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.

6. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and seeded minced jalapeños; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1½ minutes. Stir in pureed tomatoes and onions, 2 cups chicken broth, 1 tablespoon tomato paste, and 1½ teaspoons salt; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil. Cover pan and transfer to oven; bake until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring well after 15 minutes.

7. Stir in cilantro and reserved minced jalapeño with seeds to taste. Serve immediately, passing lime wedges separately.
